## PERSONAL SAFETY

1. **First aid kits** will be located on the site or in the storage trailer. If there is a fire or medical emergency, notify the instructor and site coordinator immediately.

2. **Dressing Requirements**: Always dress in clothes appropriate to your work. Wear a mask, long sleeved shirt, long pants and gloves. Baby powder on arms and all exposed skin helps keep fiberglass from embedding in the skin. Use a heavy shop vacuum and wipe downs.

3. **When cutting treated lumber, a mask and gloves should be worn.** Be sure to wash your hands after each handling and discard the mask.

4. When lifting heavy materials, always lift with your legs, not your back.

5. Wear proper gloves while working with wood and insulation to protect your hands from splinters.

6. **Wear safety glasses** while using power tools, sanding, cutting, and hammering. Safety glasses should always be worn on job sites.

7. Clothing should not be loose fitting and no earrings should hang down. Shoes must have closed toes. Tennis shoes, boots and work shoes are acceptable. Do not wear sandals. No shorts or tank tops. NO DANGLY JEWELRY.

8. While carrying long lumber, consider using a partner, use of a cart, or hold to avoid bumping others.

9. **Be aware of your surroundings at all times.**

2. Inspect the ladder before you use it.

3. Make sure the ladder is sturdy before climbing.

4. Always maintain a 3-point (two hands and a foot or two feet and a hand) contact on the ladder while climbing.

5. Keep your body within the side rails. Never over reach.

## MAINTENANCE SAFETY

1. A clean site is essential to work site safety. Please keep trash in the dumpster and scrap lumber where it belongs.

2. Trash should not be left lying on drains. Do not leave tools lying around to be tripped over.

3. Keep track of all the tools. If you see something where it does not belong, please pick it up and return it to the correct area.

4. Keep all cords tidy. Do not drape the cord over obstacles. Try to keep them flat on the ground. Be sure to unsecure extension cords properly so they do not pull out. Beware of overhead cords in the work site. Always watch for cords while on site.

5. Put the tools down with the sharp edge/sharp side down or with guards on.
