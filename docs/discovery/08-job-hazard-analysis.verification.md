## Detailed Findings

### Category 1: OSHA CONTRADICTIONS (CRITICAL - Must Fix)

**None identified.**

The document does not contradict any OSHA regulations or official guidance.

---

### Category 2: ACCURACY ISSUES (HIGH - Should Consider)

**None requiring correction.**

---

### Category 3: PARTIAL ACCURACY (MEDIUM - Consider Clarification)

#### PARTIAL ACCURACY #1: Control Hierarchy Presentation

**Claim (Lines 29-34):**
> "How do I prevent that? Identify controls: PPE (glasses, gloves, hard hat), Technique (right tool, secure the work), Environment (clear the area, secure the ladder), Communication (let others know what you're doing)"

**OSHA Standard:** OSHA's Hierarchy of Controls (endorsed in OSHA safety management guidance)

**OSHA Hierarchy of Controls (Most to Least Effective):**
1. Elimination - Remove the hazard entirely
2. Substitution - Replace with safer alternative
3. Engineering Controls - Physical barriers, guards, ventilation
4. Administrative Controls - Procedures, training, signage
5. PPE - Personal protective equipment (last resort)

**Analysis:**
The document's control categories (PPE, Technique, Environment, Communication) are valid but don't explicitly follow OSHA's standard hierarchy. PPE is listed first but should conceptually be the "last resort" per OSHA guidance. However:
- The document correctly includes multiple control types
- For volunteer contexts, PPE is often the most immediately actionable control
- The document doesn't claim PPE is the preferred control, just lists it as an option

**Verdict:** ACCEPTABLE with consideration for enhancement

**Recommendation (Optional):**
Consider adding a brief note that while PPE is listed first for convenience, eliminating hazards or changing the work method is preferable when possible. This could be a single sentence: "When possible, eliminating the hazard or changing how you do the task is better than relying on PPE."

#### PARTIAL ACCURACY #2: Timing Claims

**Claim (Lines 119, 131, 140):**
> "Three questions, takes 10 seconds"
> "10 seconds. Every time."
> "Quick scan (10-30 seconds)"

**OSHA Guidance:** OSHA 3071 does not specify a time for hazard assessment. The guidance emphasizes thoroughness over speed.

**Analysis:**
- OSHA does not contradict the concept of quick pre-task hazard checks
- OSHA 3071 distinguishes between formal JHA (documented, detailed) and informal hazard awareness
- The document's "10-30 second" claim is appropriate for the "JHA mindset" it describes
- This represents intuitive hazard awareness, not formal JHA documentation

**Verdict:** ACCEPTABLE for context

The document appropriately distinguishes between formal JHA ("formal documentation and review processes" - Line 7) and the simplified "JHA mindset" for volunteers. The timing claims are reasonable for quick mental hazard checks.

**No correction needed.**

---

#### PARTIAL ACCURACY #3: Severity Categories

**Claim (Lines 23-27):**
> Severity assessment: Minor annoyance, Trip to first aid, ER visit, Worse (crushing, electrical, falls from height)

**OSHA Guidance:** OSHA recommends assessing hazards by "severity" (how bad is the potential outcome) and "exposure" (how likely is an occurrence).

**Analysis:**
The document's severity categories are practical and appropriate:
- They align with OSHA's concept of severity assessment
- The categories are volunteer-appropriate and actionable
- OSHA doesn't prescribe specific severity categories, so these are acceptable

**Verdict:** VERIFIED

The severity framework is consistent with OSHA's risk assessment principles.

---

### Category 4: VERIFIED CLAIMS (No Action Required)

#### VERIFIED #1: JHA Definition

**Claim (Lines 5-6):**
> "Job Hazard Analysis is a systematic way of looking at a task *before* you start to identify what could go wrong and how to prevent it."

**OSHA 3071 Definition:**
> "A job hazard analysis is a technique that focuses on job tasks as a way to identify hazards before they occur. It focuses on the relationship between the worker, the task, the tools, and the work environment."

**Verdict:** VERIFIED - Accurate simplification of OSHA definition.

---

#### VERIFIED #2: Formal Documentation for Professional Construction

**Claim (Line 7):**
> "For professional construction, JHA involves formal documentation and review processes."

**OSHA Guidance:**
OSHA requires employers to conduct hazard assessments and document these evaluations. The JHA is typically "a formal process, usually accomplished with the support of the Project Engineer, Superintendent, Competent Person and often one or more employees."

**Verdict:** VERIFIED

---

#### VERIFIED #3: 3-Question Methodology

**Claim (Lines 11-34):**
The document's three questions:
1. "What could go wrong?"
2. "What would happen if it did?"
3. "How do I prevent that?"

**OSHA 3071 Core Steps:**
1. Select the job tasks to be analyzed
2. Break the job down into a sequence of steps
3. Identify hazards
4. Determine preventative measures to overcome the hazards

**Analysis:**
The document's 3-question approach maps to OSHA's steps 3-4:
- Question 1 → OSHA Step 3 (Identify hazards)
- Question 2 → Risk assessment (severity)
- Question 3 → OSHA Step 4 (Determine preventive measures)

This is an appropriate simplification for non-professional volunteers who are not conducting formal JHA but developing hazard awareness.

**Verdict:** VERIFIED - Valid pedagogical adaptation

---

#### VERIFIED #4: Hazard Categories

**Claim (Lines 17-20):**
> "Tools that could slip, Materials that could fall, Surfaces that could trip, People who could walk into your work area"

**OSHA Guidance:** OSHA identifies multiple hazard categories including physical hazards, equipment hazards, ergonomic factors, and work environment conditions.

**Verdict:** VERIFIED - Appropriate examples for volunteer construction context.

---

#### VERIFIED #5: Safety Glasses for Cutting

**Claim (Line 53):**
> "Safety glasses (always when cutting)"

**OSHA Standard:** 29 CFR 1926.102(a)(1) requires eye protection when there is exposure to flying particles. Cutting operations generate such particles.

**Verdict:** VERIFIED

---

#### VERIFIED #6: Ladder Safety Practices

**Claim (Lines 72-75):**
> "Carry with end high enough to see past, or call out 'ladder coming through', Clear path before moving, Set down carefully"

**OSHA Guidance:** These are consistent with general ladder safety principles. OSHA 1926.1053 covers ladder safety, and safe carrying practices are standard industry guidance.

**Verdict:** VERIFIED - Consistent with safe work practices

---

#### VERIFIED #7: Ladder Stabilization

**Claim (Line 96):**
> "Someone at ladder base"

**OSHA Guidance:** OSHA 1926.1053(b)(7) addresses ladder stabilization. Having someone at the ladder base is a recognized method for securing portable ladders, particularly when the ladder cannot be secured by other means.

**Verdict:** VERIFIED

---

#### VERIFIED #8: Morning Briefing Practice

**Claim (Lines 102-105):**
> "Today we're doing [task]. Quick hazard check: what could go wrong with [task]? How do we prevent that?"

**OSHA Guidance:** OSHA recommends communicating hazards to workers and involving them in hazard identification. Pre-task safety briefings are a recognized administrative control.

**Verdict:** VERIFIED - Aligns with OSHA communication and training guidance

---

#### VERIFIED #9: Ask-Don't-Tell Training Approach

**Claim (Lines 157-158):**
> "Ask, don't tell: 'What do you see that could be a problem?' vs. 'Watch out for X'"

**OSHA Guidance:** OSHA 3071 emphasizes that workers "can be a very useful internal resource" and recommends "talking to your workers and listening to their feedback" as "the most effective way to quickly find hazards."

**Verdict:** VERIFIED - Consistent with OSHA's worker engagement principles

---

#### VERIFIED #10: JHA vs. Analysis Paralysis Distinction

**Claim (Lines 135-150):**
The document distinguishes between productive JHA thinking and "analysis paralysis."

**OSHA Guidance:** OSHA 3071 focuses on practical hazard identification, not exhaustive risk cataloging. The guidance is action-oriented: identify hazards, determine controls, proceed with work.

**Verdict:** VERIFIED - Appropriate guidance for maintaining productivity while ensuring safety awareness
