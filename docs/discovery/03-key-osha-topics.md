# Key OSHA Topics for Volunteer Construction

## Priority Framework

Topics prioritized by:
1. **Frequency of exposure** - How often will volunteers encounter this?
2. **Severity of consequence** - How bad if something goes wrong?
3. **Controllability** - Can the volunteer actually do something about it?

---

## Tier 1: Essential (Every Volunteer Must Know)

### 1. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
**Why it's Tier 1**: Every volunteer will need PPE; it's the first visible safety decision.

**Key points**:
- Hard hats: When and why
- Safety glasses: Non-negotiable for cutting/nailing
- Gloves: Appropriate types for different tasks
- Footwear: Closed-toe, sturdy
- Ear protection: Power tools

**Common volunteer mistakes**:
- Wearing hard hat but tipping it back (exposes forehead)
- Safety glasses on top of head instead of on face
- Wrong glove type (too bulky for detail work, too thin for rough materials)

---

### 2. Ladder Safety
**Why it's Tier 1**: Ladders are ubiquitous and falls from ladders are a leading cause of construction injuries.

**Key points**:
- 4-to-1 rule (base 1 foot out for every 4 feet up)
- 3-point contact always
- Don't overreach (belt buckle stays between rails)
- Top steps are not for standing
- Someone holds the base

**Common volunteer mistakes**:
- Climbing too fast
- Carrying materials while climbing (use rope/bucket)
- Standing on very top
- Ladder on uneven ground

---

### 3. Manual Handling / Lifting
**Why it's Tier 1**: Everyone will lift something; back injuries are common and preventable.

**Key points**:
- Lift with legs, not back
- Get help for heavy/awkward items
- Plan the path before lifting
- Don't twist while carrying
- Golden Rule: If it feels too heavy, it is too heavy

**Common volunteer mistakes**:
- "I've got it" hero syndrome
- Twisting to set down instead of repositioning feet
- Lifting above shoulder height

---

### 4. Tool Safety Basics
**Why it's Tier 1**: Volunteers will use tools; basic awareness prevents most injuries.

**Key points**:
- Inspect before use
- Use tools for intended purpose
- Cut away from body
- Secure workpiece before cutting
- Power tools: ask before using

**Common volunteer mistakes**:
- Holding work with hand instead of clamping
- Using dull blades (requires more force, more danger)
- Not knowing where cord/air hose is

---

### 5. Situational Awareness
**Why it's Tier 1**: Construction sites are dynamic; awareness prevents walking into hazards.

**Key points**:
- Know where others are working
- Watch for overhead work
- Watch for cords, hoses, debris
- Communicate movement ("behind you", "coming through")
- Stop and look when entering new area

**Common volunteer mistakes**:
- Tunnel vision on own task
- Not announcing presence
- Walking under ladder/scaffold

---

## Tier 2: Important (Task-Specific Training)

### 6. Fall Prevention (Beyond Ladders)
**Applies when**: Working on elevated surfaces, scaffolds, or near edges.

**Key points**:
- Guardrails and their limits
- Floor hole covers
- Scaffold safety basics
- Never jump down

---

### 7. Electrical Safety Awareness
**Applies when**: Working near electrical panels, using power tools, or during renovation.

**Key points**:
- Assume wires are live until verified
- GFCI for all temporary power
- Don't overload circuits
- Water + electricity = death

---

### 8. Hazardous Materials Basics
**Applies when**: Painting, using adhesives, handling treated lumber, insulation work.

**Key points**:
- Ventilation matters
- Read labels (it's not paranoia, it's information)
- Treated lumber: wash hands, don't burn scraps
- Fiberglass: cover skin, mask up

---

### 9. Working Above/Below Others
**Applies when**: Multi-level work, roofing, scaffold work.

**Key points**:
- Communicate before dropping anything
- Establish "drop zones"
- Secure tools at height
- Hard hats below critical areas

---

### 10. Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) Thinking
**Applies when**: Starting any new task.

**Key points**:
- Stop and think before starting: what could go wrong?
- Ask: what's the worst that could happen?
- Identify controls before starting
- If unsure, ask supervisor

---

## Tier 3: Good to Know (Supervisor-Led Topics)

### 11. Fire Prevention
- Extension cord management
- Hot work awareness
- Fire extinguisher locations

### 12. Weather Awareness
- Heat illness signs
- Hydration
- When to stop work (lightning, extreme heat)

### 13. First Aid Locations
- Know where kits are
- Know who to tell if something happens
- Don't "tough it out" with injuries

## Content Mapping

Each Tier 1 topic needs all five tone variations:

| Topic | Straight Talk | Been There | Let's Figure | Real Consequences | Quick Hits |
|-------|--------------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| PPE | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Ladders | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Lifting | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Tools | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Awareness | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

Tier 2 topics: At minimum "Straight Talk" and "Quick Hits" versions.
