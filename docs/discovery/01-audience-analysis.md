# Audience Analysis: Volunteer Construction Workers

## Primary Audience Profile

**Who they are**: People "off the street" volunteering for basic construction work through faith-based or community service organizations like Building Beyond the Walls.

## Demographics & Characteristics

### Background Diversity
- **Age**: Wide range (18-70+), with peaks in college-age service groups and retirees
- **Education**: High school through advanced degrees - cannot assume any baseline
- **Language**: English may be second language; varying literacy levels
- **Physical ability**: Mixed; some very capable, others with limitations

### Experience Levels
- **Construction experience**: Little to none (that's why they're volunteers, not pros)
- **Safety training**: Minimal or forgotten from other contexts
- **Tool familiarity**: Basic household tools at best; many have never used a circular saw

### Motivation Patterns
- **Community service**: Want to help; will follow rules if they understand why
- **Learning opportunity**: Curious, want to gain skills
- **Social connection**: Here with church group, friends, family
- **Resume building**: Students, career changers
- **"Just showed up"**: Came because someone asked them to

## Learning Style Distribution

Based on adult learning research, volunteer populations typically show:

| Style | Percentage | What Works |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Visual** | ~30% | Diagrams, demonstrations, color coding |
| **Auditory** | ~25% | Verbal explanations, discussion, stories |
| **Reading/Writing** | ~15% | Written instructions, checklists |
| **Kinesthetic** | ~30% | Hands-on practice, physical demonstration |

**Key insight**: No single approach works for everyone. Multi-modal content is essential.

## Psychological Factors

### What Builds Engagement
- Feeling respected, not talked down to
- Understanding *why* rules exist
- Seeing themselves as capable learners
- Peer validation (others like me succeeded)
- Quick wins and confidence builders

### What Creates Resistance
- Being lectured at ("teacher voice")
- Feeling singled out or embarrassed
- Dense, legalistic language
- Rules without reasons
- Information overload

### Fear/Confidence Spectrum
| Profile | Fear Level | Approach Needed |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| "Eager beaver" | Low | Channel enthusiasm safely |
| "Cautious learner" | Medium | Build confidence gradually |
| "Anxious helper" | High | Reassurance, simple steps |
| "Overconfident" | Very low | Real consequences messaging |

## Communication Preferences

### What They Respond To
- Conversational, peer-to-peer tone
- "Here's what I learned" framing
- Practical, immediately useful info
- Brevity (respect for their time)
- Humor when appropriate (not forced)

### What They Tune Out
- Corporate safety-speak
- Lengthy regulation citations
- Threats and fear-mongering (beyond genuine consequence awareness)
- Acronym soup (PPE, OSHA, JHA without explanation)
- Condescending oversimplification

## Retention Challenges

### Why Safety Info Doesn't Stick
1. **Overwhelm**: Too much info at orientation, none retained
2. **Abstract**: Rules given without context
3. **No rehearsal**: Heard once, expected to remember
4. **Competing priorities**: Focused on the task, not the safety rule
5. **"Won't happen to me"**: Optimism bias about personal risk

### What Improves Retention
1. **Timing**: Information at point of use, not all upfront
2. **Chunking**: Small, digestible pieces
3. **Repetition**: Key points reinforced multiple ways
4. **Story**: Narrative sticks better than rules
5. **Personal relevance**: "This matters to YOU because..."

## Implications for Content Design

### Do
- Use peer-to-peer voice throughout
- Provide multiple tonal options (let supervisors choose what fits their group)
- Keep individual messages short (30 seconds to read/hear)
- Lead with "why this matters"
- Make action steps crystal clear
- Test comprehension before tool use

### Don't
- Assume any prior knowledge
- Use jargon without immediate explanation
- Bury the important stuff in lengthy documents
- Rely on written materials alone
- Make compliance the headline (make safety the headline)

## Validation Questions

To confirm this analysis is accurate for a specific volunteer group, ask:
1. How many have done construction work before? (expect <10%)
2. Who has used [specific tool] before?
3. What safety training have you had in any context?
4. How do you prefer to learn new things?
