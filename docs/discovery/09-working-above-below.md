# Working Above and Below Others

## The Risk

When people work at different heights on the same site, two dangers emerge:

1. **Falling objects** - Tools, materials, debris falling on people below
2. **Falling workers** - Someone above falls onto someone below

Volunteer sites often have mixed elevations: ground work, ladder work, scaffold work, even roof work. Coordination is essential.

## Core Principles

### 1. Know Who's Above and Below You

**If you're up high:**
- Know who's working below
- Never drop anything without warning
- Secure tools (don't leave them on edges)

**If you're on the ground:**
- Know who's working above
- Don't walk under ladders, scaffolds, or roof work without checking
- Listen for warnings

### 2. Establish Drop Zones

A drop zone is an area where people don't work or walk because things might fall from above.

- Mark clearly (cones, tape, verbal designation)
- Communicate: "This area is a drop zone until [time/completion]"
- Enforce: Even short cuts through a drop zone aren't worth it

### 3. Communication Before Action

**Dropping something**: "HEADS UP" or "COMING DOWN" (industry practice—use whichever your site prefers)
**Moving into an area**: "BELOW!" to alert those above that someone's entering the zone
**Starting overhead work**: Tell ground crew before you begin

## Securing Tools and Materials at Height

### The Problem
Tools at height become projectiles. A dropped hammer from 10 feet has real force. A dropped power tool can cause serious injury.

### Solutions

| Tool Type | Securing Method |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Hammers, hand tools | Tool belt with clips/loops; never set on edges |
| Power tools | Set on stable surface away from edges; if corded, secure cord |
| Loose materials (screws, nails) | Pouches, magnetic strips, closed containers |
| Cut-offs, scrap | Don't accumulate; pass down regularly or designate scrap area |
| Lumber, sheet goods | Never lean against edge; lay flat or lower via rope |

### The Rule
> "If you're at height, nothing leaves your hand by accident. If it needs to go down, it goes on purpose with warning."

## Hard Hats: When They're Critical

Hard hats aren't always required everywhere on a volunteer site, but they're mandatory in certain zones:

| Zone Type | Hard Hat? | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Under scaffold | Yes | Falling objects |
| Under roof work | Yes | Tools, debris, falling workers |
| Under ladder | Yes | If ladder user drops something |
| General ground work (no overhead) | Site-specific | Check with supervisor |

### Peer-to-Peer Framing

**Straight Talk**:
> "If someone's working above you, wear your hard hat. Not because of rules - because dropped tools don't ask permission."

**Quick Hits**:
> "Above you? Hard hat on. No exceptions."

## Multi-Level Work Coordination

### Before Starting
1. Identify who's working where (make a mental map)
2. Establish drop zones
3. Agree on communication ("BELOW," "COMING DOWN," etc.)
4. Verify hard hats are on in required areas

### During Work
1. Check before moving into new areas
2. Communicate before dropping or lowering anything
3. If you hear a warning, freeze and look up
4. Don't accumulate loose items at height

### Transitioning Levels
- When climbing up: Announce "COMING UP"
- When climbing down: Check below before descending
- Don't carry tools in hands while climbing (use belt or bucket)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Happens | Prevention |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| Walking under ladder | Shortcut | Mark zone; remind people |
| Dropping scrap without warning | "It's just a small piece" | All drops announced |
| Setting tools on edges | Convenient | Train for tool belt use |
| Forgetting hard hat | "Just for a second" | Zone enforcement |
| Assuming clear below | Focused on own task | Always check, always call |

## Peer-to-Peer Versions

### Straight Talk
> "Here's the deal with multi-level work: gravity doesn't care how careful you are. If you're above, secure everything and warn before dropping. If you're below, wear a hard hat and don't walk under active work. Takes two seconds to check up or down."

### Been There
> "I was on a ladder once, someone walked right under me. I was holding a drill - one slip and that's an ER trip for them. Now I always check below before I move anything, and I always check above before I walk anywhere. It's automatic."

### Let's Figure This Out
> "So when people are working at different heights, you've got two concerns: things falling on people, and people falling on people. The fix is coordination. Know who's above you. Know who's below you. Communicate before anything moves. Drop zone = don't go there."

### Real Consequences
> "A 2-pound hammer falling 10 feet hits with serious force. Struck-by fatalities from falling objects—including tools dropped from scaffolding—are one of OSHA's 'Fatal Four' construction hazards. If you're at height, nothing leaves your hand without a warning. If you're below active work, wear your hard hat. Not paranoia—physics."

### Quick Hits
> "Above/below safety:
> - Above you? Hard hat on.
> - You're above someone? Nothing drops without 'HEADS UP.'
> - Drop zones = stay out.
> - Tools stay on belt or secured, not on edges."
