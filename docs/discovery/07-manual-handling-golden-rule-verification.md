## Risk Assessment

**STATUS: SAFE TO PUBLISH**

No claims contradict OSHA regulations or guidance. The document's approach aligns well with OSHA's ergonomics philosophy, which emphasizes worker self-assessment and does not mandate specific weight limits.

## Detailed Findings

### Category 1: OSHA Contradictions (CRITICAL)

**None identified.**

---

### Category 2: Verified Claims

#### CLAIM #1: "If it feels too heavy, it is too heavy" (Golden Rule)
**Location:** Line 5

**OSHA/NIOSH VERIFICATION:**
- OSHA does not have a standard which sets limits on how much a person may lift or carry ([OSHA Letter of Interpretation, 2013](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/standardinterpretations/2013-06-04-0))
- NIOSH uses the Recommended Weight Limit (RWL) concept, which acknowledges individual variation
- OSHA endorses "getting help for heavy or awkward loads" as a best practice

**VERDICT: VERIFIED - ALIGNED WITH OSHA PHILOSOPHY**

This subjective approach is consistent with OSHA's guidance-based (not regulation-based) ergonomics framework. OSHA explicitly acknowledges that multiple factors affect safe lifting capacity, supporting individual self-assessment.

---

#### CLAIM #2: Individual variation affects limits (140lb vs 220lb person, prior injury, fatigue, time of day)
**Location:** Lines 19-22

**OSHA/NIOSH VERIFICATION:**
- NIOSH Lifting Equation establishes 51 lb load constant as safe for "75% of females and 90% of males" - explicitly acknowledging population variation ([CDC NIOSH - Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ergonomics/about/RNLE.html))
- NIOSH equation includes frequency factor acknowledging fatigue effects during work periods
- OSHA Technical Manual notes: "Other factors that determine risk include: how often you are lifting something" and duration ([OSHA OTM Section VII](https://www.osha.gov/otm/section-7-ergonomics/chapter-1))

**VERDICT: VERIFIED**

The claim accurately reflects ergonomic science. NIOSH explicitly designs for population variation, and factors like frequency/duration account for fatigue effects.

---

#### CLAIM #3: "Lift with legs, not back" - legs are stronger than back muscles
**Location:** Line 39

**OSHA/NIOSH VERIFICATION:**
- OSHA eTools: "Bending at the knees, not the waist, helps maintain proper spine alignment" ([OSHA Heavy Lifting eTool](https://www.osha.gov/etools/electrical-contractors/materials-handling/heavy))
- OSHA guidance: "Lift with your knees, not with your back means you should never bend forward to lift a heavy object. Instead, you should squat, secure the load, and stand by straightening your legs while keeping your back straight"
- NIOSH: "Use your legs to push up and lift the load, not the upper body or back"

**VERDICT: VERIFIED**

This is standard OSHA/NIOSH guidance, widely endorsed in official materials.

---

#### CLAIM #4: "Keep load close to body" - reduces leverage and strain
**Location:** Line 40

**OSHA/NIOSH VERIFICATION:**
- OSHA: "Keep the load as close to your body as possible with your elbows close to your sides" ([OSHA Ergonomic Principles eTool](https://www.osha.gov/etools/electrical-contractors/supplemental-information/principals))
- OSHA explains: "Bending moves the load away from the body and allows leverage to significantly increase the effective load on the back. This increases the stress on the lower spine and fatigues the muscles"
- NIOSH Lifting Equation includes "Horizontal Multiplier" - distance from body is a key factor

**VERDICT: VERIFIED**

Directly supported by OSHA and NIOSH guidance with explicit leverage/strain explanation matching the document's claim.

---

#### CLAIM #5: "Don't twist while carrying" - twisting under load damages discs
**Location:** Line 41

**OSHA/NIOSH VERIFICATION:**
- OSHA: "Never twist your torso while lifting. Stay 'nose between your toes'" ([OSHA Lifting Guidance](https://www.osha.gov/etools/electrical-contractors/materials-handling/heavy))
- NIOSH: "Do not twist your body. Step to one side or the other to turn"
- NIOSH 1991 Revised Equation added "asymmetry angle" (twisting) as key factor
- Research confirms: "Twisting, stretching, or leaning to one side are undesirable... These body motions are particularly dangerous and can cause back injury even when not combined with handling loads" ([CCOHS Back Injury Prevention](https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/inj_prev.html))
- Medical evidence: "While bending, twisting, and lifting movements trigger both cervical and lumbar herniated disc symptoms"

**VERDICT: VERIFIED**

Strongly supported. NIOSH specifically added twisting to their revised equation due to its impact on disc injury risk.

#### CLAIM #6: Sheet of plywood should be two-person job by default
**Location:** Line 75

**OSHA/NIOSH VERIFICATION:**
- OSHA guidance: "When lifting loads heavier than 50 pounds, use two or more people to lift the load"
- Standard plywood sheet (4x8 ft, 3/4"): approximately 60-70 lbs
- Ergonomic guidelines: "Two-person lifts shouldn't exceed 100 pounds total, with each person handling no more than 50 pounds"
- Additionally, plywood's size creates awkward handling regardless of weight

**VERDICT: VERIFIED**

Plywood typically exceeds the 50 lb single-person guideline and presents awkward handling due to dimensions. Two-person default is appropriate guidance.

---

### Category 3: Partially Accurate Claims

#### CLAIM #7: "Back injuries can take months to heal. Some never fully recover"
**Location:** Line 64

**BLS/NIOSH VERIFICATION:**
- BLS data: "The median number of days away from work for overexertion is 7; for repetitive motion, it is 18" ([BLS MSD Factsheet](https://www.bls.gov/iif/factsheets/msds.htm))
- NIOSH: "Back disorders are one of the leading causes of disability for people in their working years" ([NIOSH Back Belts Document](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/94-127/default.html))
- Medical literature supports that some disc injuries result in chronic conditions

**VERDICT: PARTIALLY ACCURATE**

The claim is true for severe injuries but may overstate typical recovery times. The median days away from work is measured in weeks, not months. However, the statement "some never fully recover" is supported by disability statistics.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Consider adding context: "While most back injuries heal within weeks, severe injuries can take months to heal, and some result in permanent disability."

---

### Category 4: Unsupported Claims (Needs Source)

#### CLAIM #8: Mechanical assistance recommendations (dollies, carts, rope lifts)
**Location:** Lines 108-109

**OSHA/NIOSH VERIFICATION:**
- OSHA does recommend mechanical aids as a control measure
- However, the document doesn't cite sources for this recommendation

**VERDICT: UNSUPPORTED BUT ACCURATE**

This aligns with OSHA's hierarchy of controls (engineering controls preferred over administrative controls). Consider adding a source reference.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Add citation to OSHA ergonomics guidance or note as "industry best practice."

## Conclusion

The "Golden Rule of Manual Handling" document is **well-aligned with OSHA and NIOSH guidance**. Its subjective, worker-empowering approach ("if it feels too heavy, it is") is actually more consistent with official guidance than rigid weight limits would be, since OSHA explicitly does not mandate specific lifting weights.

The supporting biomechanical principles (lift with legs, keep load close, don't twist) are directly verified by official OSHA and NIOSH publications.

**Recommendation:** The document is suitable for publication with one minor suggested revision to the back injury recovery claim for accuracy.
