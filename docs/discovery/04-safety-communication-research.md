# Effective Safety Communication Patterns

## Research-Based Principles

### 1. The "Curse of Knowledge" Problem

**The issue**: Safety trainers know so much that they forget what it's like to not know.

**Solution patterns**:
- Start with what the audience *already* knows
- Use analogies to familiar experiences
- Test comprehension with "show me" not "tell me"
- Have someone unfamiliar review content before deployment

**Application**: Every message should be reviewed with "Would someone with zero construction experience understand this?"

### 2. Story-Based Learning

**Research**: Stories are 22x more memorable than facts alone (Stanford research).

**Why stories work**:
- Create emotional engagement
- Provide context and causality
- Model both good and bad outcomes
- Make abstract rules concrete

**Pattern for safety stories**:
1. **Setup**: Relatable situation
2. **Choice point**: What did/didn't happen
3. **Consequence**: What resulted
4. **Takeaway**: Clear, applicable lesson

**Example structure**:
> "A volunteer was [doing common task]. They [made reasonable but wrong choice]. This happened: [consequence]. Now we know: [lesson]."

### 3. The Rule of Three

**Principle**: People can reliably remember 3 things; 4+ and retention drops sharply.

**Application**:
- Limit key points to 3 per topic
- Group related items in threes
- Use "3 things to remember" framing

**Why this matters for volunteers**: They're getting a lot of information at once. If everything is important, nothing is.

### 4. Active vs. Passive Voice

**Problem with passive**: "Hard hats should be worn" - by whom? Always?

**Active is clearer**: "Wear your hard hat whenever you're in the construction area."

**Pattern**: [You] + [action verb] + [when/where/why]

| Passive (Avoid) | Active (Use) |
|-----------------|--------------|
| "Safety glasses are required" | "Put on safety glasses before cutting" |
| "Materials should be lifted carefully" | "Lift with your legs, not your back" |
| "The ladder must be secured" | "Have someone hold the ladder base" |

---

### 5. Priming for Risk Awareness

**Concept**: People assess risk based on recent exposure to information about it.

**Application**:
- Mention the specific hazard *before* the task, not just in orientation
- "Point of use" safety info at the tool/location
- Brief "hazard of the day" reminders

**Example timing**:
- Morning briefing: "Today we're doing roofing. Falls are the biggest risk."
- At the ladder: Quick Hits card with ladder rules
- At the saw: "Safety glasses. Every cut. No exceptions."

---

### 6. Social Proof and Norms

**Principle**: People follow what they see others doing.

**Positive application**:
- "Most volunteers check their ladder before climbing" (norm, not rule)
- Show experienced volunteers modeling behavior
- Supervisors must demonstrate what they expect

**Negative application to avoid**:
- Don't say "People forget to..." (normalizes forgetting)
- Don't focus on rule-breakers (creates social proof for breaking rules)

---

### 7. Concrete Over Abstract

**Abstract (weak)**: "Use proper lifting technique"
**Concrete (strong)**: "Bend your knees. Keep your back straight. Hold the load close to your body."

**Pattern**: Replace adjectives with actions

| Abstract | Concrete |
|----------|----------|
| "Be careful" | "Watch where you step" |
| "Use proper PPE" | "Put on glasses, gloves, hard hat" |
| "Handle with care" | "Carry with two hands, walk - don't run" |
| "Maintain safe distance" | "Stay at least 3 feet away" |

---

### 8. Frequency vs. Severity Framing

**Two approaches to motivation**:

**Frequency** (for common hazards): "Cuts are the most common injury on site."
- Works when: The hazard is frequent but usually not catastrophic
- Creates: Awareness that "it happens"

**Severity** (for rare but serious hazards): "Falls from ladders can be fatal, even from just 6 feet."
- Works when: The consequence is severe, even if infrequent
- Creates: Appropriate caution without paranoia

**Match framing to hazard type**:
- Cuts, splinters, minor burns → Frequency framing
- Falls, electrical, crushing → Severity framing

---

### 9. Call to Action Clarity

**Every safety message needs a clear "do this"**:

| Weak (No clear action) | Strong (Clear action) |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| "Be aware of electrical hazards" | "If you see exposed wires, stop and tell a supervisor" |
| "Ladder safety is important" | "Always have someone hold the base when you climb" |
| "PPE protects you" | "Put on your hard hat now and keep it on in the work area" |

**Pattern**: [Verb] + [Object] + [When/Where/How]

---

### 10. Repetition Without Boredom

**The challenge**: Key messages need repetition, but volunteers tune out repeated lectures.

**Solutions**:
- Same message, different tones (hence our 5 variations)
- Same message, different contexts (orientation, point-of-use, debrief)
- Same message, different media (spoken, written, visual)
- Spaced repetition (day 1, day 2 reminder, week 2 refresher)

## Anti-Patterns in Safety Communication

### What Doesn't Work

| Pattern | Why It Fails | Alternative |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Information dump** | Overwhelm kills retention | Prioritize ruthlessly |
| **Scare tactics** | Creates anxiety, not behavior change | Honest consequences, not horror |
| **Compliance focus** | "You must" creates resistance | "Here's why this matters" |
| **Blame framing** | "Accidents happen when people..." | "Here's how to stay safe" |
| **Jargon** | Excludes, doesn't include | Plain language always |
| **Conditional threats** | "If you don't, you could..." | "Do this to stay safe" |

---

## Message Testing Framework

Before deploying safety content, test:

1. **Comprehension**: "What does this mean to you?"
2. **Actionability**: "What would you do based on this?"
3. **Retention**: "What do you remember from this?" (ask later)
4. **Credibility**: "Does this feel real or like corporate BS?"
5. **Tone check**: "Does this feel like a lecture or a peer helping you?"
