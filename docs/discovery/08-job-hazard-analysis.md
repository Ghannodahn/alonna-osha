# Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) for Volunteers

## What Is JHA?

Job Hazard Analysis is a systematic way of looking at a task *before* you start to identify what could go wrong and how to prevent it.

For professional construction, JHA involves formal documentation and review processes. For volunteers, we need a simplified "JHA mindset" - quick mental checks that become habit.

## JHA for Volunteers: The 3-Question Check

Before starting any task, ask:

### 1. "What could go wrong?"
Think through the task. Where are the dangers?
- Tools that could slip
- Materials that could fall
- Surfaces that could trip
- People who could walk into your work area

### 2. "What would happen if it did?"
Assess the severity:
- Minor annoyance? (splinter, small scrape)
- Trip to first aid? (cuts, small burns)
- ER visit? (falls, serious cuts, eye injuries)
- Worse? (crushing, electrical, falls from height)

### 3. "How do I prevent that?"
Identify controls:
- PPE (glasses, gloves, hard hat)
- Technique (right tool, secure the work)
- Environment (clear the area, secure the ladder)
- Communication (let others know what you're doing)

## Examples

### Example 1: Cutting lumber with a hand saw

**What could go wrong?**
- Saw could jump and cut hand
- Wood could shift and pinch saw or fly up
- Sawdust in eyes

**What would happen?**
- Hand cut: first aid to ER depending on severity
- Wood shifting: minor but could cause loss of balance
- Sawdust in eyes: irritation to injury

**How do I prevent that?**
- Safety glasses (always when cutting)
- Secure the wood (clamp or have someone hold)
- Cut away from body
- Use steady, even strokes (no rushing)

---

### Example 2: Carrying a ladder

**What could go wrong?**
- Hit someone with the end
- Trip on debris
- Pinch fingers setting it down

**What would happen?**
- Hitting someone: bruises to serious injury depending on location
- Tripping: minor to moderate injury
- Pinching: painful but minor

**How do I prevent that?**
- Carry with end high enough to see past, or call out "ladder coming through"
- Clear path before moving
- Set down carefully, watch hand placement

---

### Example 3: Nailing siding

**What could go wrong?**
- Hammer hits thumb
- Nail ricochets
- Reach too far and lose balance
- Ladder instability

**What would happen?**
- Smashed thumb: painful, possible break
- Ricochet: eye injury if no glasses
- Falling off ladder: serious injury

**How do I prevent that?**
- Safety glasses
- Start nail with holder or gentle taps before full swing
- Stay centered, move ladder rather than overreach
- Someone at ladder base

## Integrating JHA into Volunteer Workflow

### Morning Briefing (Supervisor-Led)
"Today we're doing [task]. Quick hazard check: what could go wrong with [task]? How do we prevent that?"

This takes 2 minutes and primes thinking.

### Task Introduction
Before a volunteer starts a new task:
"Before you start - what do you see that could cause problems? Good. How do we handle that?"

### Self-Check (Individual)
Teach volunteers to pause before each new task. "Before I pick up this tool, what should I be watching for?"

## Peer-to-Peer Framing

### Straight Talk
> "Before you start anything: what could go wrong? What would happen? How do you prevent it? Three questions, takes 10 seconds, saves trips to the ER."

### Been There
> "I used to just dive in. Get the job done. Then I nearly put a nail through my hand because I didn't notice the board was cracked. Now I take 10 seconds before starting anything: what could go wrong here? It's not paranoia - it's pattern recognition."

### Let's Figure This Out
> "JHA sounds technical - Job Hazard Analysis - but it's just a fancy name for 'think before you act.' What could go wrong? What would happen if it did? How do I stop that from happening? You're probably already doing this, just not consciously."

### Real Consequences
> "Most injuries happen because someone didn't see the hazard coming. Not because they were reckless - because they didn't pause to think. Ten seconds of 'what could go wrong here?' prevents hours in the ER and weeks of recovery."

### Quick Hits
> "Before any task: (1) What could go wrong? (2) How bad? (3) How to prevent? 10 seconds. Every time."

## JHA Thinking vs. Analysis Paralysis

The goal is quick, intuitive hazard awareness - not overthinking to the point of inaction.

**Good JHA mindset:**
- Quick scan (10-30 seconds)
- Notice obvious hazards
- Apply standard controls (PPE, technique, environment)
- Start task with awareness

**Overthinking looks like:**
- Cataloging every possible hazard
- Unable to start because "something might happen"
- Second-guessing basic tasks

The cure for analysis paralysis: if you've checked PPE, secured your work, and know where others are, you're ready. Start.

## Supervisor Guide: Building JHA Habits

1. **Model the behavior**: Talk through your own hazard thinking out loud
2. **Ask, don't tell**: "What do you see that could be a problem?" vs. "Watch out for X"
3. **Praise the pause**: Recognize volunteers who take a moment to assess
4. **Normalize questions**: "Good question - let's think through that together"
5. **Brief consistently**: Same JHA questions every task, until it's automatic
