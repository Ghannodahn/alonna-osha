# Message Framework and Implementation Plan

## Message Architecture

### Standard Message Structure

Every peer-to-peer safety message follows this structure:

```
[HOOK] - Grab attention with relevance
[WHY] - Connect to real consequence or benefit
[WHAT] - The key information/rule
[DO] - Clear action step
[CLOSE] - Reinforce or link to next topic
```

**Length guidelines**:
- Straight Talk: 50-75 words
- Been There: 75-125 words (stories need setup)
- Let's Figure This Out: 75-100 words
- Real Consequences: 50-100 words
- Quick Hits: 25-40 words

## Message Templates by Tone

### Straight Talk Template

```markdown
**[Topic] - Straight Talk**

[Direct opening line]. Here's what matters: [key point].

Do this: [action step 1], [action step 2], [action step 3].

[One-line reinforcement why it matters].
```

### Been There Template

```markdown
**[Topic] - Been There**

[Story setup - first time I did X / I saw Y happen]. [What went right/wrong].

Here's what I learned: [lesson derived from experience].

So now I always: [specific behavior change].

Trust me on this one.
```

### Let's Figure This Out Template

```markdown
**[Topic] - Let's Figure This Out**

Okay, so [topic] - this [confused me at first / seems like a lot / doesn't always make sense].

Let's break it down: [explanation of why/how].

The bottom line: [simplified takeaway].

Makes sense? [Optional follow-up question or check].
```

### Real Consequences Template

```markdown
**[Topic] - Real Consequences**

[Statistic or brief scenario]. That's not a scare tactic - that's reality.

Here's why this matters: [connection to consequence].

This is how you protect yourself: [action].

[Grounding statement - "You want to go home tonight the same way you came in."]
```

### Quick Hits Template

```markdown
**[Topic] - Quick Hits**

[Time/length promise]. [Topic]:

1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]

[Single sentence why or result].
```

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before any message is finalized:

**Voice Check**
- [ ] Sounds like a peer, not a teacher
- [ ] No corporate/compliance language
- [ ] Uses "you" and "I/we" appropriately
- [ ] Would a real volunteer say this?

**Clarity Check**
- [ ] Action is unmistakably clear
- [ ] No jargon without explanation
- [ ] Grade 8 reading level or below
- [ ] Could be understood by non-native speaker

**Accuracy Check**
- [ ] Aligns with OSHA requirements
- [ ] No oversimplification that creates risk
- [ ] Specific enough to be actionable

**Effectiveness Check**
- [ ] "Why" is included
- [ ] Memorable (rule of 3, story, concrete)
- [ ] Appropriate tone for the situation
- [ ] Tested with sample audience if possible

## Maintenance Plan

### Regular Review Triggers
- After any incident (even minor)
- New tool/process introduced
- Volunteer feedback collected
- Annually at minimum

### Version Control
- Messages dated
- Changes documented
- Old versions archived (not deleted)
- Supervisor notified of updates

---

## Success Metrics

**Leading indicators** (measure regularly):
- Volunteer comprehension quiz scores
- Supervisor observations of behavior
- Questions asked (more questions = more engagement)

**Lagging indicators** (measure over time):
- Incident rates
- Near-miss reports (more reports = better awareness, not worse safety)
- Volunteer confidence surveys
