# Peer-to-Peer Tone Variations

## Core Principle: One Volunteer Helping Another

All tone variations share these qualities:
- Never authoritative or "from above"
- Genuine, not performative
- Respects the listener as a capable adult
- Shares experience rather than dictates rules
- Honest about what actually matters

---

## 1. Straight Talk

**Voice**: A direct friend who doesn't waste your time with fluff.

**Characteristics**:
- Gets to the point immediately
- No hedging or corporate softening
- Confident but not arrogant
- Says "here's the deal" not "please be advised"

**Best for**:
- Busy or impatient learners
- Those who appreciate efficiency
- Rule-followers who just want clarity
- Quick refreshers for experienced volunteers

**Example phrases**:
- "Look, this is the one thing you actually need to remember..."
- "Real talk: this is the part that gets people hurt."
- "Don't overcomplicate it. Just do X."
- "Here's the 30-second version..."

**Opening pattern**:
> "[Topic]. Here's what matters: [key point]. Do this: [action]. That's it."

---

## 2. Been There (Experiential)

**Voice**: Someone sharing wisdom from their own experience on the jobsite.

**Characteristics**:
- Uses "I" statements and personal anecdotes
- Admits past mistakes or close calls
- Creates connection through shared experience
- Validates the learning curve

**Best for**:
- Auditory and social learners
- Those who need emotional connection to remember
- Nervous volunteers who need reassurance
- Building trust with skeptical audiences

**Example phrases**:
- "First time I picked up a circular saw, nobody told me..."
- "I learned this one the hard way..."
- "When I started, I thought hard hats were overkill. Then..."
- "Here's something I wish someone had told me..."

**Opening pattern**:
> "When I first [started doing X / used Y tool], I [made this mistake / didn't know this]. Here's what I learned..."

---

## 3. Let's Figure This Out (Collaborative)

**Voice**: A peer who's learning alongside you, thinking out loud.

**Characteristics**:
- Uses "we" language
- Poses questions, then answers them
- Acknowledges that safety rules can seem confusing
- Makes the listener feel like a partner, not a student

**Best for**:
- Those who resist being "taught"
- Collaborative learners
- Building buy-in with resistant groups
- Complex topics that benefit from exploration

**Example phrases**:
- "Okay, so PPE - what actually matters here?"
- "Let's think through this together..."
- "You might be wondering why we do it this way..."
- "Here's what threw me at first..."

**Opening pattern**:
> "Okay, so [topic] - this confused me at first too. Let's break it down: [explanation]. Makes sense?"

---

## 4. Real Consequences (Stakes-Aware)

**Voice**: Honest friend who's seen things go wrong and wants to protect you.

**Characteristics**:
- Doesn't shy away from real outcomes
- Not fear-mongering, but honest
- Connects abstract rules to concrete consequences
- Balances gravity with respect

**Best for**:
- Overconfident volunteers who dismiss safety as "overkill"
- High-stakes topics (falls, electrical, etc.)
- Creating lasting impressions
- When other approaches haven't landed

**Example phrases**:
- "I knew a guy who thought hard hats were overkill..."
- "Here's why this rule exists. It's not bureaucracy - it's because..."
- "Falls are the #1 cause of construction deaths. Not 'falling off buildings' - falling off ladders."
- "This seems like a small thing, but..."

**Opening pattern**:
> "[Statistic or story]. That's why we [do this]. It's not about rules - it's about you going home tonight."

---

## 5. Quick Hits (Time-Respectful)

**Voice**: A busy peer who respects that you have work to do.

**Characteristics**:
- Extremely concise
- Bulleted or numbered
- Action-focused
- No preamble or wind-up

**Best for**:
- Point-of-use reminders (at the tool, on the ladder)
- Experienced volunteers who need refreshers
- Morning briefings
- Anyone who's already heard the full version

**Example phrases**:
- "30 seconds - here's what'll keep you safe today"
- "Three things. That's it."
- "Quick check before you start:"
- "[Topic] in a nutshell:"

**Opening pattern**:
> "[Topic], [time/length commitment]. [Numbered list of 2-4 points]. Go."

## Matching Tones to Situations

| Situation | Primary Tone | Secondary Tone |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| First-day orientation | Been There | Let's Figure This Out |
| High-risk task intro | Real Consequences | Straight Talk |
| Tool demonstration | Let's Figure This Out | Straight Talk |
| Morning safety briefing | Quick Hits | Been There |
| One-on-one correction | Been There | Real Consequences |
| Printed signage | Quick Hits | Straight Talk |
| Group discussion | Let's Figure This Out | Been There |
| Refresher for returnees | Quick Hits | Real Consequences |

---

## Tone Blending

Tones can be combined. Example combining "Been There" and "Quick Hits":

> "Quick story from my first build - grabbed a ladder without checking it, rung snapped. Now I do these three things every time: check the rungs, check the locks, check the feet. Takes 10 seconds."

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Even in peer-to-peer voice, avoid these traps:

| Anti-Pattern | Example | Why It Fails |
|--------------|---------|--------------|
| Fake casual | "Hey buddy, so like, OSHA says..." | Feels performative |
| Humble-brag | "I've done this a million times so trust me..." | Alienates newbies |
| False equivalence | "We've all made mistakes" (about serious issues) | Minimizes real risk |
| Excessive hedging | "You might want to maybe consider..." | Unclear, no action |
| Buddy-buddy overreach | Multiple exclamation points, forced humor | Unprofessional |

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any peer-to-peer content, verify:

- [ ] Would a real volunteer actually say this?
- [ ] Is the action clear?
- [ ] Does it respect the listener's intelligence?
- [ ] Is it free of jargon (or does it explain jargon immediately)?
- [ ] Could someone remember this on the jobsite?
- [ ] Does it pass the "not a lecture" test?
