# Peer-to-Peer Rewrite Opportunities

## Analysis of Original Content

The Building Beyond the Walls source material uses standard safety-training language. Below is a systematic analysis of what needs rewriting and why.

---

## Pattern 1: Passive/Compliance Language → Active/Peer Voice

### Examples from Source

| Original (Compliance) | Problem | Peer-to-Peer Rewrite Direction |
|----------------------|---------|-------------------------------|
| "Safety glasses should always be worn on job sites" | Passive, unclear who/when | "Put on your safety glasses before picking up any tool" |
| "A clean site is essential to work site safety" | Corporate abstract | "Keep your area clear - you'll trip over what you leave out" |
| "Be aware of your surroundings at all times" | Vague, no action | "Before you start, look around: who's nearby? What's overhead? Where are the cords?" |
| "REMEMBER-ALWAYS EXERCISE CAUTION AND COMMON SENSE!" | ALL CAPS lecturing | "Trust your gut. If something feels unsafe, it probably is. Ask." |

---

## Pattern 2: Rule-First → Why-First

### Examples from Source

| Original | Problem | Peer-to-Peer Rewrite Direction |
|----------|---------|-------------------------------|
| "When cutting treated lumber, a mask and gloves should be worn" | Rule without reason | "Treated lumber has chemicals that absorb through your skin. Gloves and mask - every time." |
| "Always maintain a 3-point contact on the ladder" | Rule sounds arbitrary | "3-point contact (two hands, one foot or two feet, one hand) keeps you stable. It's the reason people don't fall." |
| "Do not use the top step/rung of a ladder" | No explanation | "The top isn't designed to hold you. It's there to give you something to grab. Stand on it and you've got nothing to catch yourself with." |

---

## Pattern 3: Generic Warning → Specific Action

### Examples from Source

| Original | Problem | Peer-to-Peer Rewrite Direction |
|----------|---------|-------------------------------|
| "Check all tools for damage prior to use" | What damage? What to look for? | "Before using a tool: Is the blade sharp? Is the cord frayed? Does anything wobble that shouldn't? 10-second check." |
| "Keep track of all the tools" | Vague responsibility | "When you put down a tool, put it somewhere obvious. Random tools on the ground become tripping hazards." |
| "Be sure to watch out for the person next to you" | Nice sentiment, no specifics | "If you're swinging a hammer, drilling, or cutting - check where your neighbors are. Give a heads up: 'Cutting here!'" |

---

## Pattern 4: Dense Lists → Prioritized Essentials

### Source has 7 points under "Personal Safety" - Rewrite Strategy:

**Original structure**: 9 bullets, equal weight, mixing important and less important.

**Peer-to-peer structure**:
- Lead with the 3 things that prevent the most injuries
- Group related items
- Explain why as you go

**Example rewrite approach**:

> "Three things will prevent most injuries: wear your PPE (glasses, gloves, hard hat), lift with your legs, and watch where you're going. Everything else builds on these."

---

## Pattern 5: Prohibition-Focused → Permission + Boundary

### Examples from Source

| Original (Prohibition) | Problem | Peer-to-Peer Rewrite Direction |
|-----------------------|---------|-------------------------------|
| "Power tools are NOT allowed on Building Beyond the Walls walking sites" | Emphasis on restriction | "For walking sites, we stick to hand tools. If you see a task that seems to need a power tool, check with a supervisor - there's usually another way, or they can take care of it." |
| "No shorts or tank tops. NO DANGLY JEWELRY." | ALL CAPS prohibition | "Long pants and sleeves protect your skin from splinters and fiberglass. Jewelry catches on things - take it off before you start." |
| "Never put one foot on a rung and the other foot on another surface" | "Never" without why | "Both feet on the ladder, always. Split stance means a split second from falling." |

## Priority Rewrite Queue

Based on frequency of use and risk level:

### Immediate Priority (High Impact)

1. **Ladder Safety section** - Complete rewrite in all 5 tones
2. **Personal Safety intro** - Needs complete peer-to-peer makeover
3. **PPE list** - Transform from checklist to meaningful guidance

### Second Priority (Important)

4. **Hand/Power Tool Safety** - Needs specificity and why
5. **Maintenance Safety** - Good content, wrong tone
6. **The disclaimer** - Replace with genuine closing statement

### Lower Priority (Polish)

7. **First aid kit mention** - Minor, can stay brief
8. **Fire prevention** - Not in original, but should be added

---

## Specific Sections Analysis

### Section: "THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFETY" (Introduction)

**Original**:
> "The safety and health of our workers and volunteers is the number one priority for this organization..."

**Analysis**:
- Corporate speak ("number one priority for this organization")
- Passive voice
- Vague promises ("Be safe and enjoy!")
- No actionable content

**Rewrite opportunity**: Transform into peer-to-peer welcome that sets the tone:
> "Hey - welcome to the site. I'm going to share what I wish someone had told me my first day. The goal is simple: you go home the same way you came in. No trips to the ER, no stories about 'that one time.' Let's make that happen."

---

### Section: LADDER SAFETY

**Original content** (high priority for rewrite):
1. Second person required to hold ladder
2. Inspect before use
3. Make sure it's sturdy before climbing
4. Maintain 3-point contact
5. Keep body within side rails - never overreach
6. Don't use top step unless designed for it
7. Never split stance between ladder and other surface

**Analysis**:
- Good rules, wrong voice
- Missing "why" on most points
- Could be consolidated with better structure

**Rewrite strategy**: Create 5 tone variations showing same content through different lenses.

---

### Section: PERSONAL SAFETY

**Key rewrite points**:
- Item 4 (lifting) is critical but buried
- Item 6 (safety glasses) needs more emphasis
- Item 7 (clothing) mixes safety and dress code
- Item 8 (carrying lumber) is actually good advice
- Item 9 ("be aware") is too vague to be useful

---

### Section: DISCLAIMER

**Original**:
> "THERE IS NO WAY THIS BRIEF SUMMARY CAN COVER ALL THE SAFETY ISSUES ON A JOB SITE..."

**Analysis**: Legal CYA language that undermines credibility.

**Rewrite opportunity**: Honest closing that builds confidence:
> "This isn't everything - there's no way to cover every situation. But if you remember the basics, ask questions when you're unsure, and trust your instincts, you'll be fine. We've got experienced folks here who've seen it all. Use them. That's what they're here for."

## Next Steps

1. Create full ladder safety content in all 5 tones (highest priority, most teachable)
2. Draft peer-to-peer introduction/welcome
3. Revise PPE section with "why" for each item
4. Work through remaining sections systematically
