# Safety-Themed Visual Design Principles

## Purpose

This document establishes the foundational visual design principles that will underpin all five conversation style visual systems. These principles ensure:

1. **Safety relevance** - Visual language that resonates with construction/safety contexts
2. **Accessibility** - Designs that work across literacy levels and learning styles
3. **Compliance awareness** - Alignment with ANSI/OSHA visual standards where appropriate
4. **Effectiveness** - Research-backed approaches to visual learning and retention

## ANSI Z535 Safety Color System

The ANSI Z535 standard provides a universally recognized color language for safety communication. Our visual styles should leverage (but not be limited to) these established meanings.

### Standard Safety Colors

| Color | ANSI Meaning | Our Application |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Red** | DANGER - Will cause death/serious injury | Critical warnings, stop actions |
| **Orange** | WARNING - May cause death/injury | Important cautions, high-risk content |
| **Yellow** | CAUTION - Could cause minor/moderate injury | Moderate risk, pay attention |
| **Blue** | NOTICE - Non-injury information | Procedural information, tips |
| **Green** | SAFETY - Safety equipment/instructions | Safe actions, proper techniques |
| **Black/White** | Contrast and text | Primary content, high legibility |

### Application Guidance

- **Straight Talk**: Lean into high-contrast black/white with strategic yellow accents
- **Been There**: Warm variants of safety colors (aged yellow, weathered orange)
- **Let's Figure This Out**: Marker-style interpretations (educational, less severe)
- **Real Consequences**: Full ANSI spectrum for gravity; red/orange prominent
- **Quick Hits**: Simplified to highest-contrast pairs only

## Visual Learning Research Principles

Research from [SC Training](https://training.safetyculture.com/blog/visual-learning-statistics/), [Learning Guild](https://www.learningguild.com/articles/12-ways-to-design-better-infographics-for-elearning), and adult learning studies informs these guidelines:

### 1. Clarity Over Clutter

> "A simple, well-designed flowchart is infinitely more useful than a complex, confusing one."

**Application:**
- Each visual element serves a purpose
- One core idea per visual
- Generous whitespace for cognitive rest
- Avoid decorative elements that don't inform

### 2. Visual Hierarchy

Establish what learners see **first, second, third**:

| Priority | Visual Treatment |
|----------|------------------|
| Critical | Largest, boldest, safety color accent |
| Supporting | Secondary size, supporting color |
| Reference | Smaller, muted, available but not dominant |

**Techniques:**
- Position (top/center = most important)
- Size (larger = more important)
- Color (saturated = attention-drawing)
- Isolation (whitespace around = emphasis)

### 3. Contiguity Principle

> "Place text close to the visuals it describes."

**Application:**
- Labels directly on or adjacent to diagrams
- Captions immediately below images
- Icons inline with their text explanations
- No hunting for related information

### 4. Color for Differentiation

> "Select colors that are well separated on the color wheel."

**Good pairs:** Blue/orange, yellow/purple, red/green (with care for colorblindness)
**Poor pairs:** Blue/purple, red/orange (too similar)

**Application:**
- DO/DON'T comparisons: green vs. red
- Before/after: muted vs. saturated
- Categories: distinct, non-adjacent hues

### 5. Signals and Cues

> "Use color and contrast as visual signals to support focused attention."

**Application:**
- Callout boxes for critical information
- Arrows pointing to important details
- Highlighted text for action items
- Icons as quick-scan indicators

## Adult Learning (Andragogy) Principles

From [Education Northwest](https://educationnorthwest.org/insights/effective-design-adult-learners) and adult learning research:

### 1. Self-Direction

Adults prefer autonomy in learning. Visual design should:
- Allow scanning and self-paced consumption
- Provide clear structure for navigation
- Avoid forced linear progression where possible
- Use clear signposting ("Start here," "Key takeaway")

### 2. Experience-Based

Adults learn by connecting to existing knowledge. Visual design should:
- Use familiar construction/tool imagery
- Show realistic scenarios, not abstract diagrams
- Include "before" states they'll recognize
- Validate that the learning curve is normal

### 3. Practical Application

Adults need to see immediate relevance. Visual design should:
- Lead with "what to do" over "why"
- Show the action, not just explain it
- Include checklists and quick-reference formats
- Connect every visual to a jobsite reality

### 4. Chunking

> "Chunk information into smaller, manageable pieces."

**Application:**
- Maximum 3-5 items per group
- Visual separation between chunks
- Progressive disclosure (overview → detail)
- One concept per page/card/section

---

## Microlearning and Attention

From [SC Training research](https://training.safetyculture.com/blog/visual-learning-statistics/):

> "Older adults take an average of 67 seconds to fully focus on a task."

### Implications for Visual Design

| Format | Attention budget | Design response |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Pocket card | < 30 seconds | Maximum compression, icon-driven |
| Signage | < 10 seconds | Single message, large type |
| Handbook page | 1-2 minutes | Chunked, scannable sections |
| Full topic | 3-5 minutes | Clear progression, rest points |

### Scannability Requirements

Every visual should pass the "5-second test":
- Can a viewer identify the topic in 5 seconds?
- Can they find the main action in 10 seconds?
- Can they determine if it's relevant to them immediately?

## OSHA Communication Requirements

From [OSHA guidelines](https://www.osha.gov/construction):

### Language Accessibility

> "Training must be done in a language and vocabulary that workers understand."

**Visual design response:**
- Rely on universal pictograms where possible
- Minimize text-heavy explanations
- Use clear, simple language when text is needed
- Ensure visuals carry meaning independent of text

### Positive Tone

> "Maintain a positive and encouraging tone. Successful programs reward, rather than discipline."

**Visual design response:**
- Show correct behavior, not just incorrect
- Use "DO" visuals as prominently as "DON'T"
- Avoid fear-based imagery except where genuinely appropriate
- Frame content as empowering, not restrictive

---

## Construction-Specific Visual Vocabulary

### Universal Construction Imagery

Icons and images that immediately signal "construction safety":

| Category | Visual Elements |
|----------|-----------------|
| **PPE** | Hard hat, safety glasses, gloves, boots, ear protection |
| **Tools** | Hammer, saw, drill, ladder, tape measure |
| **Hazards** | Falling objects, trip hazards, electrical, heights |
| **Actions** | Lifting technique, climbing, carrying, cutting |
| **Signals** | Stop hand, thumbs up, pointing, waving off |

### Figure Style Options

| Style | Best for | Production needs |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **Silhouette** | Quick Hits, signage | Simple, reproducible |
| **Stick figure** | Let's Figure This Out | Diagram-friendly |
| **Simplified human** | Straight Talk, general use | Clean, professional |
| **Realistic illustration** | Been There, Real Consequences | More production time |
| **Photography** | Real Consequences, training | Requires photo assets |

## Format Specifications

### Print Constraints

| Format | Size | Color | Typography minimum |
|--------|------|-------|---------------------|
| Handbook page | Letter (8.5x11) | Color or B&W | 10pt body, 14pt headers |
| Insert sheet | Half-letter | Color preferred | 9pt body, 12pt headers |
| Pocket card | 3x5 or 4x6 | Color or 2-color | 8pt body, 10pt headers |
| Poster | 11x17 minimum | Color | 18pt body, 36pt headers |

### Digital Considerations

- Responsive layouts for variable screen widths
- High contrast for outdoor/mobile viewing
- Touch-friendly spacing for interactive elements
- PDF fallback for print-from-digital workflow

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any visual element:

- [ ] Does it leverage safety color conventions appropriately?
- [ ] Is the hierarchy clear (first/second/third)?
- [ ] Does text stay close to related visuals?
- [ ] Can it be scanned in 5 seconds?
- [ ] Is it chunked into 3-5 items max?
- [ ] Does it work in grayscale (accessibility)?
- [ ] Would a construction volunteer recognize the context?
- [ ] Is the tone empowering rather than punitive?
