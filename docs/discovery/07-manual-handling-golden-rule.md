# The Golden Rule of Manual Handling

## The Rule

**"If it feels too heavy, it is too heavy."**

This simple principle overrides all technical guidance about lifting limits, weight charts, and proper technique. It respects the individual's self-assessment and removes the pressure to "tough it out."

---

## Why This Works

### 1. Removes Ego from the Equation
Traditional safety messaging often implies there's a "right way" to lift heavy things. This creates pressure to attempt lifts that feel wrong because "I should be able to do this."

The Golden Rule gives explicit permission to ask for help.

### 2. Accounts for Individual Variation
- A 140-lb person and a 220-lb person have different limits
- Someone with a prior back injury has different limits
- Someone tired at 4pm has different limits than at 9am
- Weather, footing, awkward shapes - all affect what's "too heavy"

No weight chart captures all of this. The person's own sense does.

### 3. Simple and Memorable
Complex lifting guidelines (bend knees to X degrees, keep load within Y inches of body, etc.) are technically correct but hard to recall in the moment.

"Does this feel too heavy? Then it is." - anyone can remember and apply this.

## Supporting Principles

The Golden Rule doesn't replace technique - it works alongside it:

| Principle | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Lift with legs, not back** | Legs are stronger than back muscles |
| **Keep load close to body** | Reduces leverage and strain |
| **Don't twist while carrying** | Twisting under load damages discs |
| **Plan the path before lifting** | Prevents awkward mid-lift decisions |
| **Get help for awkward shapes** | Shape matters as much as weight |

## Peer-to-Peer Framing

### Original (Source Material)
> "When lifting heavy materials, always lift with your legs, not your back."

### Golden Rule Reframe

**Straight Talk**:
> "Here's the one lifting rule that matters: if it feels too heavy, it is. Your back knows. Listen to it. Ask for help or find another way."

**Been There**:
> "I used to try to 'hero' everything - carry more, prove I could handle it. Then I spent two weeks unable to bend over. Wasn't worth it. Now my rule is simple: if it feels too heavy, it is. No shame in asking for a hand."

**Let's Figure This Out**:
> "So all the lifting rules - bend your knees, keep it close, don't twist - they're good. But here's the thing: none of that matters if the load is too heavy for you. The rule underneath all the rules? If it feels too heavy, it is. That's permission to ask for help."

**Real Consequences**:
> "Back injuries can take months to heal. Some never fully recover. The moment something feels too heavy, you have a choice: ask for help now, or deal with pain later. There's no 'powering through' when it comes to your spine."

**Quick Hits**:
> "Lifting: If it feels too heavy, it is. Get help. No glory in back injuries."

## Application Scenarios

| Scenario | Golden Rule Application |
|----------|------------------------|
| Sheet of plywood | Heavy and awkward - two-person job by default |
| Box of screws | Lift test: pick up one end. Too heavy? Get help. |
| Lumber carry | Length matters - one person lift, two person carry |
| End of day fatigue | What you could lift at 9am might be too heavy at 4pm |
| Wet/muddy conditions | Reduced grip + slippery = treat everything as heavier |

## Training Integration

### How to introduce the Golden Rule:

1. **Say it**: "The one rule that overrides everything else - if it feels too heavy, it is."
2. **Demonstrate**: Have volunteer lift something borderline. Ask "Does that feel too heavy?" Validate whatever answer they give.
3. **Normalize asking for help**: Supervisor visibly asks for help with something, modeling the behavior.
4. **Reinforce throughout**: When you see someone struggling: "Remember - if it feels too heavy, it is. Let me give you a hand."

## Common Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I can handle it" | "Cool - but if at any point it doesn't feel right, just say so. That's the smart move, not weakness." |
| "It's just one more" | "And the ER is full of 'just one more' stories. Take the trip." |
| "I don't want to slow things down" | "An injury slows things down way more. We've got time." |

## Complementary Practices

The Golden Rule pairs with:

- **Mechanical assistance**: Dollies, carts, rope lifts reduce manual load
- **Breaking loads down**: Heavy bag can become two lighter bags
- **Team lifts**: Two-person protocol for anything borderline
- **Rest breaks**: Fatigue increases perceived and actual difficulty
