## Executive Summary

### Overall Compliance Status

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Total claims analyzed | 6 |
| Verified with OSHA support | 5 |
| Partially accurate (needs revision) | 1 |
| Contradicts OSHA guidance | 0 |
| Unsupported (no OSHA source) | 0 |

### Risk Assessment

**STATUS: ACCEPTABLE FOR PUBLICATION**

No claims contradict OSHA guidance. The document provides general safety principles that align well with OSHA's approach to falling object protection. One minor accuracy improvement is recommended for the "killed by dropped tools" claim to strengthen it with specific source data.

---

## Detailed Findings

### Category 1: OSHA Contradictions (CRITICAL - Must Fix)

**None identified.** ✅

---

### Category 2: Verified Claims

#### CLAIM #1: Falling objects and falling workers are dangers when working at different heights

**Location:** Lines 5-8
**Claim:** "When people work at different heights on the same site, two dangers emerge: 1. Falling objects - Tools, materials, debris falling on people below 2. Falling workers - Someone above falls onto someone below"

**Verification:**
- **29 CFR 1926.501(c)** explicitly addresses protection from falling objects
- **OSHA eTool on Struck-By hazards** confirms falling objects are one of the "Fatal Four" construction hazards
- Per OSHA statistics, struck-by incidents account for approximately 8-11% of construction fatalities

**VERDICT:** ✅ **VERIFIED** - Accurate characterization of hazards

---

#### CLAIM #2: Hard hats required under scaffolds, roof work, and ladders

**Location:** Lines 65-74
**Claim:** Table showing hard hats required "Under scaffold" (Yes - Falling objects), "Under roof work" (Yes - Tools, debris, falling workers), "Under ladder" (Yes - If ladder user drops something)

**OSHA Standard:** 29 CFR 1926.100(a)

**What OSHA Says:**
> "Employees working in areas where there is a possible danger of head injury from impact, or from falling or flying objects, or from electrical shock and burns, shall be protected by protective helmets."

**Additionally, 29 CFR 1926.501(c):**
> "When an employee is exposed to falling objects, the employer shall have each employee wear a hard hat..."

**VERDICT:** ✅ **VERIFIED** - Document correctly identifies zones where overhead work creates falling object hazards requiring hard hats per OSHA 1926.100(a) and 1926.501(c)

---

#### CLAIM #3: Drop zones should be established and marked

**Location:** Lines 28-35
**Claim:** "A drop zone is an area where people don't work or walk because things might fall from above."

**OSHA Standard:** 29 CFR 1926.501(c) and 1926.502(j)

**What OSHA Says:** OSHA recognizes barricading as an acceptable method for falling object protection:
> "Barricading the area to which objects could fall and prohibiting employees from entering the barricaded area"

**VERDICT:** ✅ **VERIFIED** - Drop zones align with OSHA's barricading requirements as an acceptable falling object protection measure

---

#### CLAIM #4: Tools must be secured at height

**Location:** Lines 44-61
**Claim:** Table showing tool securing methods (tool belts, stable surfaces away from edges, pouches, containers, passing down regularly, rope lowering)

**OSHA Standard:** 29 CFR 1926.502(j)

**What OSHA Says:**
> "Where tools, equipment, or materials are piled higher than the top edge of a toeboard, paneling or screening shall be erected..."

Additionally, OSHA's eTool on Struck-By hazards recommends:
- Keeping potential fall objects far enough from the edge
- Using toeboards, screens, or guardrail systems to prevent objects from falling

**VERDICT:** ✅ **VERIFIED** - Tool securing recommendations align with OSHA's falling object protection principles

---

#### CLAIM #5: Impact force of dropped tools

**Location:** Line 47, Lines 130-131
**Claims:**
- "A dropped hammer from 10 feet has real force"
- "A 2-pound hammer falling 10 feet hits with serious force"

**Physics Verification:**
- A 2 lb (0.9 kg) object falling 10 feet (3 m) reaches approximately 24.5 ft/s (7.5 m/s) velocity at impact
- Impact energy = approximately 13.6 foot-pounds
- Per engineering references, a 2 kg hammer dropped from ~5 metres (16 ft) can be fatal even with a hard hat
- Hard hats are designed for lower-energy impacts and cannot prevent all fatal outcomes from dropped objects

**VERDICT:** ✅ **VERIFIED** - The physics claim is accurate. Dropped tools from 10 feet do have significant impact force capable of causing serious injury.

---

### Category 3: Accuracy Issues (HIGH - Should Consider Revision)

#### CLAIM #6: People have been killed by dropped tools

**Location:** Lines 130-131
**Claim:** "People have been killed by dropped tools."

**Verification Sources:**
- BLS Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries confirms struck-by fatalities include "items as small as a power tool rolling off scaffolding"
- OSHA statistics show 8-11% of construction fatalities are struck-by incidents
- Struck-by falling objects is one of OSHA's "Fatal Four" construction hazards

**Accuracy Assessment:** ✅ **VERIFIED** but could be strengthened

**Issue:** While the claim is true, it lacks specific source citation. Adding a reference would strengthen credibility.

**Recommended Revision (Optional):**
Current:
> "A 2-pound hammer falling 10 feet hits with serious force. People have been killed by dropped tools."

Suggested:
> "A 2-pound hammer falling 10 feet hits with serious force. Struck-by fatalities from falling objects—including small tools dropped from scaffolding—are one of OSHA's 'Fatal Four' construction hazards."

**Risk Level:** LOW - Claim is accurate, citation would strengthen it

---

## Claims Not Present (No Issues)

The document appropriately **does not make** the following claims that would require verification:

1. **No specific fall protection height thresholds stated** - The document discusses multi-level coordination generally without claiming specific heights (6 ft construction / 4 ft general industry). This is appropriate since it's focused on overhead hazards, not fall protection systems.

2. **No guardrail specifications mentioned** - Document doesn't make claims about guardrail heights (42" +/- 3") or toeboard specifications (3.5" minimum). These weren't relevant to the document's scope.

3. **No specific statistics cited** - The document uses general language ("real force," "serious force") rather than specific statistics, avoiding accuracy issues.

## Conclusion

**Document Status:** ✅ **APPROVED FOR PUBLICATION**

The document "09-working-above-below.md" accurately represents OSHA safety principles for working at multiple elevations. All claims about falling object hazards, hard hat requirements, and drop zone establishment align with OSHA regulations and guidance. The document wisely avoids making specific numerical claims that would require precise citation, instead focusing on general safety principles that are well-supported by OSHA standards.

**Optional Enhancement:** Consider adding a brief source reference for the "killed by dropped tools" statement to strengthen credibility, though the claim is factually accurate as written.
