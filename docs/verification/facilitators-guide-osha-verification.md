## Detailed Findings

### Category 1: OSHA Contradictions (CRITICAL)

**None identified.**

---

### Category 2: Verified Claims (No Action Needed)

#### Claim #1: 4:1 Ladder Ratio
**Location:** Lines 32, 126
**Claim:** "For every 4 feet up, the base is 1 foot out"

**OSHA Standard:** 29 CFR 1926.1053(b)(5)(i)
**What OSHA Says:** "Non-self-supporting ladders shall be used at an angle such that the horizontal distance from the top support to the foot of the ladder is approximately one-quarter of the working length of the ladder."

**Verdict:** VERIFIED
**Notes:** The 4:1 ratio is the correct plain-language explanation of the 75.5-degree angle requirement.

---

#### Claim #2: 3-Point Contact
**Location:** Lines 122, 127
**Claim:** "Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand—always"

**OSHA Standard:** 29 CFR 1926.1053(b)(22)
**What OSHA Says:** "An employee shall not carry any object or load that could cause the employee to lose balance and fall."

**Verdict:** VERIFIED
**Notes:** While OSHA doesn't use the exact phrase "3-point contact," this is the industry-accepted interpretation supported by OSHA guidance and NIOSH recommendations. The standard implicitly requires maintaining balance, which 3-point contact achieves.

---

#### Claim #3: Top Step Not for Standing
**Location:** Line 129
**Claim:** "It's there to hold onto, not stand on"

**OSHA Standard:** 29 CFR 1926.1053(b)(13)
**What OSHA Says:** "The top or top step of a stepladder shall not be used as a step."

**Verdict:** VERIFIED
**Notes:** Directly matches OSHA regulation.

**Source:** [29 CFR 1926.1053 - Ladders](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1926/1926.1053)

---

#### Claim #4: Spotter for Ladder
**Location:** Line 128
**Claim:** "Someone holds the base or at least knows you're climbing"

**OSHA Status:** Not explicitly required in 29 CFR 1926.1053
**Verdict:** VERIFIED as industry best practice
**Notes:** This is a sound safety practice consistent with OSHA's general duty clause requirements. Not presenting it as an OSHA requirement is correct.

---

#### Claim #5-7: Lifting Ergonomics
**Location:** Lines 99-102
**Claims:**
- "Get close to the load before you lift"
- "Test the weight with a small lift before committing"
- "Team lifts for plywood, long lumber, anything unwieldy"

**OSHA/NIOSH Guidance:** NIOSH Ergonomic Guidelines for Manual Material Handling (Publication No. 2007-131)
**What NIOSH Says:** "Work in the 'power zone' (mid-thigh to mid-chest). Keep loads close to the body. Use team lifts for heavy or awkward loads."

**Verdict:** VERIFIED
**Notes:** OSHA has no specific lifting standard but references NIOSH guidelines under the General Duty Clause. These claims align with NIOSH best practices.

- [NIOSH Ergonomic Guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/media/pdfs/Ergonomic-Guidelines-for-Manual-Material-Handling_2007-131.pdf)

#### Claim #8: Safety Glasses When Cutting/Nailing
**Location:** Line 178
**Claim:** "Anytime there's cutting, nailing, flying debris, dust"

**OSHA Standard:** 29 CFR 1926.102(a)(1)
**What OSHA Says:** "The employer shall ensure that each affected employee uses appropriate eye or face protection when exposed to eye or face hazards from flying particles..."

**Verdict:** VERIFIED
**Notes:** Directly matches OSHA requirement.

**Source:** [29 CFR 1926.102 - Eye and Face Protection](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1926/1926.102)

---

#### Claim #9: Guards Stay On Tools
**Location:** Line 180
**Claim:** "They're there for a reason—leave them alone"

**OSHA Standard:** 29 CFR 1926.300(b)(2)
**What OSHA Says:** "When power operated tools are designed to accommodate guards, they shall be equipped with such guards when in use."

**Verdict:** VERIFIED
**Notes:** Directly matches OSHA requirement.

---

#### Claim #10: Treated Lumber Chemicals
**Location:** Line 179
**Claim:** "Treated lumber has chemicals"

**OSHA/NIOSH Support:** CDC/NIOSH guidance on treated wood handling
**Verdict:** VERIFIED
**Notes:** Accurate statement. Pressure-treated lumber contains preservatives (historically CCA, now primarily ACQ and CA-C) that warrant hand protection.

---

#### Claim #11: Lift with Legs
**Location:** Line 210
**Claim:** "close, squat, lift with legs"

**NIOSH Guidance:** "Squat, secure the load, and stand by straightening your legs while keeping your back straight."

**Verdict:** VERIFIED
**Notes:** Consistent with NIOSH ergonomic guidelines.

---

### Category 3: Claims Needing Clarification

**None - All previously identified issues have been resolved.**

---

### Category 4: Resolved Issues (Previously Identified)

#### Claim #12: 3-Point Contact Definition - RESOLVED ✓
**Location:** Line 127
**Previous Claim:** "Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand—always"
**Previous Issue:** Language could be interpreted loosely regarding timing.

**Current Language (v1.1):** "Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand touching the ladder—at all times while climbing"

**Verification Status:** RESOLVED - The enhancement was correctly applied. The current language explicitly clarifies that contact must be maintained "at all times while climbing," which aligns with OSHA guidance and industry best practices.

**Source:** [29 CFR 1926.1053(b)(22)](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1926/1926.1053) - "An employee shall not carry any object or load that could cause the employee to lose balance and fall." The 3-point contact rule is the accepted industry interpretation supporting balance maintenance.

## Summary

### Final Compliance Checklist

- [x] All regulatory threshold claims verified against current CFR
- [x] Statistics cross-referenced with BLS/NIOSH data (none in document)
- [x] Industry context (construction) clear throughout
- [x] No claims contradict OSHA regulations
- [x] Best practices clearly not presented as requirements
- [x] No CFR citations needed (document uses plain language intentionally)
- [x] **All previous verification issues resolved**
- [x] **No new issues introduced during revision**

### Document Strengths

1. **Uses plain language** without claiming specific OSHA citations—appropriate for peer-to-peer training
2. **Focuses on actionable behaviors** rather than regulatory thresholds
3. **Correctly frames practices as experience-based** ("what I learned") rather than mandates
4. **Covers the "Focus Four" hazards** (falls, struck-by, caught-in/between, electrical) appropriately for shed construction
5. **Defers technical details** to point-of-use delivery as recommended
6. **3-point contact clarification** now explicitly states "at all times while climbing"

### Recommendations

1. **No changes required** for OSHA compliance
2. ~~Optional: Add "at all times while climbing" to 3-point contact guidance~~ **COMPLETED in v1.1**
3. **Maintain tone:** The "Been There" peer approach is appropriate—it shares experience without overstating regulatory requirements

### Previous Issues Resolution Status

| Issue | Original Status | Current Status |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| 3-point contact clarity | Needs clarification | ✓ RESOLVED |
| All other claims | Verified | ✓ Remains verified |
