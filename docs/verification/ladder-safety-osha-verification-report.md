## Detailed Claim Analysis

### Document 1: ladder-safety-all-tones.md

---

#### CLAIM #1: "Falls from ladders are the leading cause of volunteer injuries"
**Location:** Line 6 (Key facts)
**Category:** Statistic (injury cause ranking)

**OSHA/BLS Verification:**
- BLS CFOI 2023: Falls are the leading cause of death in construction (39.2% of fatalities)
- CDC/NIOSH: 81% of construction fall injuries treated in ERs involve ladders
- CPWR Data Bulletin 2024: Falls remain leading cause of injury in construction

**Assessment:** **PARTIALLY ACCURATE - NEEDS CONTEXT**

**Issue:** The claim is reasonable for construction contexts, but:
1. "Volunteer injuries" specifically is not tracked separately by BLS/OSHA
2. The broader claim that ladder falls are a leading cause is well-supported

**Recommendation:** Add "on construction sites" or cite specific organization data if available:
> "Falls from ladders are a leading cause of injuries on volunteer construction sites"

---

#### CLAIM #2: "Most falls are from under 10 feet - not dramatic heights"
**Location:** Line 7, repeated at Lines 18, 76

**OSHA/BLS Verification:**
- CDC MMWR 2014: 50% of non-fatal ladder injuries occurred below 10 feet
- BLS CFOI 2023: 64.4% of fatal construction falls were from 6-30 feet (not under 10)
- Greenberg Ruby Law (citing BLS/NIOSH): "Most ladder deaths are from falls of 10 feet or less"

**Assessment:** **PARTIALLY ACCURATE - NEEDS CLARIFICATION**

**Issue:** The claim conflates fatal and non-fatal statistics:
- ✅ TRUE for non-fatal injuries (majority under 10 feet)
- ⚠️ MISLEADING for fatal falls (most occur between 6-30 feet)

**Recommended Revision:**
> "Many serious fall injuries happen from heights under 10 feet - you don't need to fall far to get hurt"

---

#### CLAIM #3: "3-point contact prevents most falls"
**Location:** Line 8

**OSHA Verification:**
- 29 CFR 1910.23(b)(11-13): Three-point contact is mandatory
- OSHA FactSheet OSHA 3660: Confirms 3-point contact as key prevention measure
- OSHA Letter of Interpretation (2019-06-05): Clarifies grasp requirements

**Assessment:** **VERIFIED ✅**

The claim aligns with OSHA requirements. Three-point contact is:
- Mandated under 1910.23(b)(12)
- Recognized as a primary fall prevention measure

---

#### CLAIM #4: "Having someone hold the base prevents most tip-overs"
**Location:** Line 9

**OSHA Verification:**
- 29 CFR 1926.1053(b)(5)(i): Addresses ladder angle for stability
- NIOSH Statistics: 40% of ladder injuries caused by ladder sliding out at base
- No explicit OSHA requirement for "someone holding the base"

**Assessment:** **UNSUPPORTED - ORGANIZATION POLICY, NOT OSHA REQUIREMENT**

**Issue:** OSHA does not require another person to hold the ladder base. This appears to be an organizational policy ("Building Beyond the Walls requires...").

**Recommendation:** Clarify this is organizational policy, not OSHA requirement:
> "Our policy: someone holds the base. This prevents the most common cause of ladder accidents - the base sliding out."

Or cite the NIOSH statistic:
> "40% of ladder injuries are caused by the base sliding out. Having someone hold it prevents this."

---

#### CLAIM #5: "The top step isn't for standing"
**Location:** Lines 10, 26, 44, 62, 84, 99

**OSHA Verification:**
- 29 CFR 1926.1053(b)(13): "The top or top step of a stepladder shall not be used as a step"
- 29 CFR 1910.23(b)(9): Same requirement for general industry

**Assessment:** **VERIFIED ✅**

Direct alignment with OSHA regulation.

---

#### CLAIM #6: "Keep your belt buckle within the side rails" / "overreaching"
**Location:** Lines 24, 59, 98

**OSHA Verification:**
- OSHA Safety Guidelines: "Keep body centered between side rails"
- 29 CFR 1926.1053 Appendix A: References maintaining body position
- OSHA FactSheet OSHA 3660: "Do not overreach"

**Assessment:** **VERIFIED ✅**

The "belt buckle rule" is a practical interpretation of OSHA's overreaching guidance.

---

#### CLAIM #7: "Ladder falls are the #1 injury on volunteer sites" / "#1 volunteer injury"
**Location:** Lines 54, 101

**OSHA/BLS Verification:**
- BLS does not track volunteer injuries separately
- Construction data supports falls as #1 injury cause

**Assessment:** **UNSUPPORTED - NEEDS ORGANIZATION DATA**

**Issue:** "Volunteer" injury statistics are not tracked by OSHA/BLS.

**Recommendation:** Either:
1. Cite internal organization data if available
2. Generalize to construction: "Falls are the #1 cause of injury on construction sites"

---

#### CLAIM #8: "Falls from ladders kill construction workers every year"
**Location:** Line 72

**OSHA/BLS Verification:**
- BLS CFOI 2023: 109 fatalities from portable ladders/stairs in construction
- Historical average: ~300 fatal falls per year in construction (CPWR)

**Assessment:** **VERIFIED ✅**

---

### Document 2: 06-rewrite-opportunities.md

---

#### CLAIM #9: "Always maintain a 3-point contact on the ladder"
**Location:** Line 29 (in rewrite example)

**Assessment:** **VERIFIED ✅**

Same as Claim #3 above. Aligns with OSHA 1910.23(b)(11-13).

---

#### CLAIM #10: "Do not use the top step/rung of a ladder"
**Location:** Line 30 (in rewrite example)

**Assessment:** **VERIFIED ✅**

Same as Claim #5 above. Aligns with 1926.1053(b)(13).

---

#### CLAIM #11: "Keep body within the side rails. Never overreach."
**Location:** Line 123 (original content reference)

**Assessment:** **VERIFIED ✅**

Same as Claim #6 above.

---

#### CLAIM #12: "Never split stance between ladder and other surface"
**Location:** Lines 71, 125

**OSHA Verification:**
- OSHA guidance documents warn against bridging
- 1926.1053(b)(4): Ladders shall be used only on stable and level surfaces unless secured

**Assessment:** **VERIFIED ✅**

---

#### CLAIM #13: "Three things will prevent 80% of injuries"
**Location:** Line 59 (example rewrite)

**OSHA/BLS Verification:**
- No OSHA/BLS source for "80%" figure

**Assessment:** **PARTIALLY ACCURATE - NEEDS SOURCE OR REVISION**

**Issue:** The "80%" figure is unsourced. While the three items (PPE, proper lifting, situational awareness) are valid, the percentage claim needs verification.

**Recommendation:** Either:
1. Find and cite source for 80%
2. Remove specific percentage: "These three things prevent most injuries"

---

#### CLAIM #14: "Second person required to hold ladder"
**Location:** Line 119

**Assessment:** Same as Claim #4 - **ORGANIZATION POLICY, NOT OSHA REQUIREMENT**

---

## Regulatory Threshold Verification

| Requirement | Document Claim | OSHA Standard | Status |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| Fall protection height (construction) | Not stated | 6 feet (1926.501) | N/A |
| Three-point contact | ✅ Stated | 1910.23(b)(11-13) | **CORRECT** |
| Top step prohibition | ✅ Stated | 1926.1053(b)(13) | **CORRECT** |
| Ladder angle | Not stated | 75.5° / 4:1 ratio | N/A |
| Body positioning | ✅ Stated (belt buckle rule) | OSHA guidance | **CORRECT** |

---

## Missing OSHA Requirements (Not Mentioned in Documents)

The following OSHA requirements are relevant to ladder safety but not covered:

1. **Ladder angle:** 4-to-1 ratio (75.5 degrees) per 1926.1053(b)(5)(i)
2. **Ladder inspection:** Required before each use per 1926.1053(b)(15)
3. **Ladder extension above landing:** 3 feet per 1926.1053(b)(1)
4. **Load capacity:** Must support 4x intended load per 1926.1053(a)(1)

**Recommendation:** Consider adding ladder angle guidance (easy to remember 4:1 rule) in future revisions.
