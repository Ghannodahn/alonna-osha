## FRONT: When Someone's Struggling

### What to say (and what to skip)

| ❌ Skip | ✓ Say Instead |
|--------|---------------|
| "Don't fall" | "Three points on the ladder" |
| "Calm down" | "I'm right here" |
| "It's not a big deal" | "That's a reasonable concern" |
| "Just do it" | "One step at a time" |
| "Be careful" | "Watch the nail by your foot" |
