## THE SCRIPT

### [0:00-1:00] OPENING — 1 Minute

**[Say this, then make it your own:]**

> "Hey everyone, I'm [YOUR NAME].
>
> Before we start building, let's spend 15 minutes on what keeps us safe today.
>
> I've been volunteering on builds for [YOUR EXPERIENCE]. I've made mistakes, learned from them, and I'd rather you skip the mistakes part.
>
> We're building a 10x16 shed. Four things matter most: **how we lift, how we use ladders, how we stay aware of each other, and how we handle tools.**
>
> Let's go through them quick."

⏱️ **TIMING CHECK: You should be at about 1:00 now**

### [1:00-3:00] POINT 1: LIFTING & CARRYING — 2 Minutes

**[The message:]**
> "Your back doesn't heal like a broken board. Ask for help with anything heavy or awkward."

**[Cover these four things:]**
1. "Get **close to the load** before you lift"
2. "**Test the weight** with a small lift before committing"
3. "**Ask for help** if it's heavy, awkward, or you're not sure"
4. "**Team lifts** for plywood, long lumber, anything unwieldy"

**[Share YOUR story — or use one of these:]**

> *Option A:* "First few times I volunteered, I tried to prove myself. Carried more than I should. Then I spent two weeks barely able to tie my shoes after moving a stack of shingles solo. Wasn't worth it."

> *Option B:* "Sheet goods look light. They're not—and even when they're manageable, the wind catches them, they twist, you lose control. I always grab someone for plywood now."

**[Quick engagement:]**
> "Anyone here lifted something they shouldn't have? What happened?"
> *[Let 1-2 people share briefly. Nod. Move on.]*

⏱️ **TIMING CHECK: You should be at about 3:00 now**

### [3:00-5:00] POINT 2: WORKING AT HEIGHTS — 2 Minutes

**[The message:]**
> "Three points touching the ladder at all times. Someone knows you're up there. The top step is for holding—your highest standing step is the third one down."

**[Cover these four things:]**
1. "**4:1 ratio:** For every 4 feet up, the base is 1 foot out"
2. "**3-point contact:** Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand—at all times while climbing"
3. "**Spotter:** Someone holds the base or at least knows you're climbing"
4. "**Top step:** It's your handhold—your highest standing step is the third one down"

**[Share YOUR story — or use one of these:]**

> *Option A:* "I was carrying trim with one hand, holding a rung with the other. Came close enough to falling that my heart was pounding for an hour. Now I tie a rope or have someone hand things up."

> *Option B:* "I used to think asking someone to hold the ladder was embarrassing. Then I watched a ladder kick out from under someone. Now I ask every time."

**[Quick engagement — if ladder nearby:]**
> "Show me roughly what 4:1 looks like."
> *[Let someone demonstrate. Give a quick tip if needed.]*

⏱️ **TIMING CHECK: You should be at about 5:00 now**

### [5:00-7:00] POINT 3: WORKING AROUND OTHERS — 2 Minutes

**[The message:]**
> "Call out before you move. Know who's above you, below you, and beside you."

**[Cover these four things:]**
1. "**'Heads up!'** before moving lumber, swinging materials"
2. "**Know your neighbors:** Who's working above? Below? Beside?"
3. "**Staging discipline:** Keep materials clear of walkways"
4. "**Shared space:** We're inside a larger structure—other work is happening around us"

**[Share YOUR story — or use one of these:]**

> *Option A:* "Someone walked right under my ladder without saying anything. I was holding a drill. If I'd dropped it... Now I always call out when I'm moving, and I look up before walking under anyone."

> *Option B:* "Saw someone swing a 2x4 around without looking. Caught another volunteer in the shoulder. A quick 'coming through' would've prevented it."

**[Quick engagement:]**
> "What's your call when you're moving something long?"
> *[Expected: "Heads up," "Behind you," "Coming through." Validate any answer.]*

⏱️ **TIMING CHECK: You should be at about 7:00 now**

### [7:00-9:00] POINT 4: TOOL SAFETY — 2 Minutes

**[The message:]**
> "PPE on. Guards stay on. If something feels wrong, stop and ask."

**[Cover these five things:]**
1. "**Safety glasses:** Anytime there's cutting, nailing, flying debris, dust"
2. "**Gloves:** Splinters are real; treated lumber has chemicals"
3. "**Guards:** They're there for a reason—leave them alone"
4. "**Cord awareness:** Trip hazards, pinch points, unplug by the plug"
5. "**If it feels wrong, stop:** The universal rule"

**[Share YOUR story — or use one of these:]**

> *Option A:* "I grabbed a hammer with a loose head once. First swing, the head flew off. Could've hit someone. Now I do a quick check—five seconds—before I use anything."

> *Option B:* "Used to hold pieces with one hand and cut with the other. Then the piece shifted and I nearly cut myself. Now I clamp everything. Still got all my fingers."

**[Quick engagement:]**
> "What's one thing you always check before using a tool?"
> *[Let a few people answer. Builds collective awareness.]*

⏱️ **TIMING CHECK: You should be at about 9:00 now**

### [9:00-12:00] QUICK DEMO — 3 Minutes

**[Pick ONE based on what's available:]**

#### Option A: Ladder Setup
1. "Let me show you 4:1 ratio in person"
2. *[Set up ladder with correct angle]*
3. "Who wants to demonstrate 3-point contact?"
4. *[Have volunteer climb partway while explaining]*
5. "And who'll be our spotter?"
6. *[Position spotter at base]*

#### Option B: Lifting Technique
1. *[Grab something moderately heavy—toolbox, stack of boards]*
2. "Watch: get close, squat, lift with legs"
3. *[Demonstrate slowly]*
4. "Now you try it. Talk me through what you're doing."
5. *[Have volunteer demonstrate while explaining their actions]*

#### Option C: Communication Calls
1. *[Pretend to pick up a long board]*
2. "Watch: 'Heads up, moving lumber!'"
3. *[Model the call with volume and direction]*
4. "Everyone together—let's hear it: 'Heads up!'"
5. *[Group practices the call]*

🔄 **The pattern: You do it → They try → Group confirms**

⏱️ **TIMING CHECK: You should be at about 12:00 now**

### [12:00-15:00] QUESTIONS & CLOSE — 3 Minutes

**[Handle questions:]**

| If... | Say... |
|-------|--------|
| You know it | Answer simply, move on |
| Need to check | "Good question. Let me find out and get back to you." |
| Off-topic | "Let's capture that for later—staying focused for now." |
| Challenge | "Fair point. What's been your experience?" |

**[Wrap it up:]**

> "Those are the big four for today:
> - **Lift smart**
> - **Three points on the ladder**
> - **Watch out for each other**
> - **Respect the tools**
>
> If you're unsure about something during the build—**ask**. That's not slowing things down, that's being smart.
>
> Who to ask? *[Point to site lead/supervisors]* These folks are your go-to.
>
> Any last questions?"

**[Wait. Answer if any. Then:]**

> "Let's build smart and look out for each other. Thanks for your attention."

✅ **DONE — You should be at 15:00**

## HANDLING SITUATIONS (Reference)

### Someone Looks Nervous (RACE — 10 seconds)

| Step | What to do | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **R**ecognize | Notice their state | Gripping ladder tight, eyes darting |
| **A**cknowledge | Brief validation | "First time up there? That wobbly feeling is totally normal." |
| **C**oncrete | One specific action | "Hands here, feet here. One rung at a time." |
| **E**mpower | Reinforce capability | "Good—you've got it." |

### Group Too Quiet
- Use pairs: "Turn to the person next to you and answer this..."
- Or share more stories to model openness

### Someone Dominating
- "Thanks—who else has a thought?"
- Break eye contact, turn slightly
- "In one sentence, what's your take?"

### Skeptic ("I've done this for years")
- "You've clearly got experience."
- "Your experience would help the newer folks—want to keep an eye out together?"
