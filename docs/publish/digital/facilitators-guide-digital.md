## How to Use This Guide

You're an experienced volunteer who's been asked to train newer volunteers on safety. This guide gives you everything you need for a 15-minute safety briefing before today's shed build.

**What this guide is:** A conversation you adapt. A peer sharing experience. A framework that works.

You're someone who's been there before. That's exactly why you're the right person for this.

### 📚 Companion Documents

| Document | When to Use | What It Is |

## Before You Start

### ⏱️ Prep Time: 5-10 Minutes

**Know your group:**
- How many people? (Ideal: 4-6 per facilitator)
- Any first-timers? (Pair them with experienced volunteers after the briefing)
- Any language considerations?

**Check your space:**
- Can everyone see you?
- Do you have a ladder nearby to demonstrate 4:1 ratio?
- Is it quiet enough to be heard?

**Review the four points:**
1. 🏋️ Lifting & Carrying
2. 🪜 Working at Heights
3. 👥 Working Around Others
4. 🔧 Tool Safety

If you can only remember one thing from each point, that's enough. The stories will come naturally once you start.

### 🧠 Your Mindset

You're sharing what you've learned, not teaching a class. Think of it like explaining something to a friend who's new to this.

| Instead of thinking... | Think... |
|------------------------|----------|
| "I have to cover everything" | "I'll share the stuff that actually matters" |
| "What if they ask something I don't know?" | "I'll say 'good question, let me find out'" |
| "I'm not qualified for this" | "I've done this work; that qualifies me" |

## Opening (1 Minute)

### 💬 What to Say

*Read this once, then put it in your own words:*

> "Hey everyone, I'm [Name]. Before we start building, let's spend 15 minutes on what keeps us safe today.
>
> I'm someone who's been doing this a while. I've made mistakes, learned from them, and I'd rather you skip the mistakes part.
>
> We're building a 10x16 shed inside this larger structure. Four things matter most today: how we lift, how we use ladders, how we stay aware of each other, and how we handle tools.
>
> Let's go through them quick."

### ✅ What You're Accomplishing

- **Connection:** They know you're a peer, not an instructor
- **Relevance:** They know this applies to today's specific work
- **Permission:** They know questions are welcome
- **Time frame:** They know this won't drag on

## 🆘 When Someone's Nervous (RACE)

Throughout your session, you may notice someone looking tense, hesitant, or overwhelmed. Here's a 10-second approach that helps:

| Step | What | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| **R**ecognize | Notice their state | They're gripping the ladder tight, eyes darting |
| **A**cknowledge | Brief validation | "First time up there? That wobbly feeling is totally normal." |
| **C**oncrete action | One specific thing to do | "Hands here, feet here. One rung at a time." |
| **E**mpower | Reinforce their capability | "Good—you've got it." |

**Why this works:** When someone's nervous, telling them to "calm down" backfires—their brain processes "calm" then tries to apply "down" and often fails. Validation first, then a concrete action, gives them something to focus on instead of their fear.

**When to use it:**
- Someone hesitates at a ladder
- A first-timer looks overwhelmed by instructions
- Anyone seems embarrassed to ask a question
- During the demo when someone volunteers but freezes

## Core Point 1: Lifting & Carrying (2 Minutes)

### 💡 The Message

> **Your back doesn't heal like a broken board. Ask for help with anything heavy or awkward.**

### 📝 What to Cover

- **Get close to the load** before you lift
- **Test the weight** with a small lift before committing
- **Ask for help** if it's heavy, awkward, or you're not sure
- **Team lifts** for plywood, long lumber, anything unwieldy

### 📖 Your Story (pick one or share your own)

> "First few times I volunteered, I tried to prove myself. Carried more than I should. Stacked things alone that needed two people. Then I spent two weeks barely able to tie my shoes after moving a stack of shingles solo. Wasn't worth it."

> "Sheet goods look light. They're not—and even when they're manageable weight-wise, the wind catches them, they twist, you lose control. I always grab someone for plywood now. Takes 30 seconds, saves your whole day."

### ❓ Quick Check

After you share, ask: *"Anyone here lifted something they shouldn't have? What happened?"*

Let one or two people share briefly. This cements the point.

## Core Point 2: Working at Heights (2 Minutes)

### 💡 The Message

> **Three points touching the ladder at all times. Someone knows you're up there. The top step is not a step.**

### 📝 What to Cover

- **4:1 ratio:** For every 4 feet up, the base is 1 foot out
- **3-point contact:** Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand touching the ladder—at all times while climbing
- **Spotter:** Someone holds the base or at least knows you're climbing
- **Top step:** It's there to hold onto, not stand on

### 📖 Your Story (pick one or share your own)

> "First time I used a ladder on a build, I was carrying trim with one hand, holding a rung with the other. Came close enough to falling that my heart was pounding for an hour. Now I always tie a rope or have someone hand things up to me."

> "I used to think asking someone to hold the ladder was embarrassing. Then I watched a ladder kick out from under someone. The guy was fine, but only because he was close to the ground. Now I ask every time."

### ❓ Quick Check

Point to a ladder if one's nearby: *"Show me roughly what 4:1 looks like."* Let someone demonstrate. Offer a tip if they'd like one.

## Core Point 3: Working Around Others (2 Minutes)

### 💡 The Message

> **Call out before you move. Know who's above you, below you, and beside you.**

### 📝 What to Cover

- **"Heads up!"** before moving lumber, swinging materials
- **Know your neighbors:** Who's working above? Below? Beside?
- **Staging discipline:** Don't stack materials where people walk
- **Shared space:** We're inside a larger structure—other work is happening around us

### 📖 Your Story (pick one or share your own)

> "I was focused on my task once, and someone walked right under my ladder without saying anything. I was holding a drill. If I'd dropped it... Now I always call out when I'm moving, and I look up before walking under anyone."

> "Saw someone swing a 2x4 around without looking. Caught another volunteer right in the shoulder. Happened too fast to catch. A quick 'coming through' would've prevented it."

### ❓ Quick Check

*"What's your call when you're moving something long?"*

Expected answers: "Heads up," "Behind you," "Coming through," etc. Validate whatever they say.

## Core Point 4: Tool Safety Essentials (2 Minutes)

### 💡 The Message

> **PPE on. Guards stay on. If something feels wrong, stop and ask.**

### 📝 What to Cover

- **Safety glasses:** Anytime there's cutting, nailing, flying debris, dust
- **Gloves:** Splinters are real; treated lumber has chemicals
- **Guards:** They're there for a reason—leave them alone
- **Cord awareness:** Trip hazards, pinch points, unplug by the plug
- **"If it feels wrong, stop":** The universal rule

### 📖 Your Story (pick one or share your own)

> "I grabbed a hammer with a loose head once. First swing, the head flew off. Could've hit someone. Now I do a quick check—five seconds—before I use anything. Does it wobble? Is the blade straight? Is the cord frayed?"

> "Used to hold pieces with one hand and cut with the other. Seemed faster. Then the piece shifted and I nearly cut myself. Now I clamp everything or ask someone to hold it. I've still got all my fingers."

### ❓ Quick Check

*"What's one thing you always check before using a tool?"*

Let a few people answer. Builds collective awareness.

## Quick Demo (3 Minutes)

This is where hands-on practice makes things stick. When asking for volunteers, some people freeze up—that's normal. If someone volunteers but hesitates, acknowledge it: "First time doing this in front of people? Totally fine—I'll walk you through it." Then give them one concrete step at a time.

### 🎯 Pick ONE to Demonstrate

Choose based on what's available and what your group will be doing today:

#### Option A: Ladder Setup
- Show the 4:1 ratio in person
- Have someone demonstrate 3-point contact
- Ask for a volunteer to be the "spotter"

#### Option B: Lifting Technique
- Grab something moderately heavy (toolbox, stack of boards)
- Show "close, squat, lift with legs"
- Have someone try it and talk through what they're doing

#### Option C: Communication Calls
- Pretend to pick up a long board
- Model "Heads up, moving lumber!"
- Have the group practice the call

### 🔄 The Demo Pattern

1. **You do it** while explaining
2. **Ask someone to try** while you guide
3. **Group confirms** they've got it

Don't rush this. Hands-on practice is what makes things stick.

## Questions & Close (3 Minutes)

### 💬 Handling Questions

| Situation | What to Say |
|-----------|-------------|
| You know the answer | Answer simply, move on |
| You want to double-check | "Good question. Let me find out and get back to you." |
| It's off-topic | "That's a good one for later—let's capture it and stay focused for now." |
| It's a challenge | "Fair point. What's been your experience?" |

### 🏁 Wrap It Up

> "Those are the big four for today: lift smart, three points on the ladder, watch out for each other, respect the tools.
>
> If you're unsure about something during the build—ask. That's not slowing things down, that's being smart.
>
> Who to ask? [Point to site lead/supervisors]. These folks are your go-to.
>
> Any last questions before we get started?"

### 👋 Send Them Off

> "Let's build smart and look out for each other. Thanks for your attention."

## Handling Challenges

### 🤫 The Quiet Group

If no one's responding to your questions:

Sometimes groups are quiet because they're processing—that's okay. You can:
- Use pairs: "Turn to the person next to you and answer this: [question]"
- Invite someone to share: "[Name], what do you think?"
- Share more of your own stories to model openness

### 🗣️ The Talker

If someone's dominating:

- "Thanks—who else has a thought?"
- Break eye contact and turn slightly to signal "wrap up"
- Use time limits: "In one sentence, what's your take?"

### 🤨 The Skeptic

If someone pushes back on safety ("I've done this for years without problems"):

Experience-based skepticism usually comes from competence—they've developed good instincts. Channel that:
- Recognize: They've built real skills over time
- Acknowledge: "You've clearly got experience"
- Redirect: "Your experience would help the newer folks—want to keep an eye out together?"
- Stay peer-level: You're sharing, not convincing

### 🎓 The Know-It-All

If someone wants to take over:

- Channel it: "Since you know this stuff, want to demo the ladder setup?"
- Acknowledge and move on: "That's another way to do it. Here's what we're sharing today."

### 😰 Someone's Uncomfortable

If someone seems nervous, lost, or embarrassed—use [RACE](#-when-someones-nervous-race):

1. **Recognize:** You notice they're quiet, avoiding eye contact, or looking overwhelmed
2. **Acknowledge:** Pull them aside briefly: "This is a lot to take in—totally normal to feel that way"
3. **Concrete:** Give them one thing: "Stick close to [experienced volunteer's name] when we start"
4. **Empower:** "You'll pick it up fast. Everyone does."

After the briefing:
- Pair them with an experienced volunteer
- Check in privately: "Hey, any questions you wanted to ask one-on-one?"

## After the Session

### 📝 What Went Well / What to Improve

Spend 2 minutes mentally noting:
- Which point got the best response?
- What questions came up?
- Anything you'd change for next time?

### 📢 Report Questions You Couldn't Answer

Tell the site supervisor about any questions you couldn't answer. Someone should follow up.

### 👥 Buddy Up First-Timers

Make sure every new volunteer is paired with someone experienced before they start working. The experienced volunteer watches out for them, answers questions, and helps them feel comfortable asking when unsure.

## Point-of-Use Reminders

These topics don't need training time—they get delivered at the task:

| Topic | Deliver When |
|-------|--------------|
| Specific tool operation | At the tool, before first use |
| Material hazards (treated lumber, etc.) | At the staging area |
| Emergency procedures | Posted + verbal at start |
| Detailed PPE fitting | Station before work begins |

Your job in the 15-minute session is to prime awareness. Details come at the task.

## The Facilitator's Mindset

### 💭 Remember

- **You're a peer**, not an expert
- **Your stories are your teaching**, not rules or statistics
- **Questions are welcome**—you don't have to know everything
- **"Let me find out"** is always an acceptable answer
- **15 minutes is enough** if you hit the key points

### 🎯 The Goal

When volunteers leave your session, they should:
- Know the four things that matter most today
- Feel comfortable asking questions
- Know who to ask
- Have at least one story in their head that'll stick

That's it. That's success.
