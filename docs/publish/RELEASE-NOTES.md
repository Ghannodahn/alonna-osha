## Known Limitations

1. **Scenario-Specific:** Currently optimized for "10x16 shed inside larger structure" scenario. May need adaptation for other build types.

2. **15-Minute Format:** Fixed session length. Shorter or longer formats would require restructuring.

3. **English Only:** No translations currently available.

4. **Peer-to-Peer Approach:** Designed for experienced volunteers training newer volunteers. Not suitable as sole safety training for entirely new crews.
