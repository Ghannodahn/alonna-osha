# Soft Phrases Guide: Language That Actually Helps

**Companion to:** [Facilitator's Guide: Peer-Led Safety Training](facilitators-guide.md)
**Purpose:** What to say when someone's nervous, stuck, or stressed

---

## Why This Guide Exists

You've got the safety content down. You know the four points, the demos, the stories. But what do you say when someone freezes on a ladder? When their hands are shaking? When they say "I can't do this"?

That's what this guide is for.

The words you choose in those moments matter more than you might think. Some phrases that seem helpful actually make things worse. Others—simple, specific, grounded—can bring someone back from the edge of panic.

This isn't about memorizing a script. It's about understanding *why* some language works and having a few go-to phrases you can make your own.

---

## The Science (Just Enough to Be Useful)

### Your Brain on "Don't"

When you hear "don't fall," your brain does this:

1. Activates the concept of "falling"
2. Tries to apply the negation
3. Under stress, step 2 often fails

This is called ironic process theory. The harder you try not to think about something, the more it pops up. Under stress—when someone's nervous on a ladder, for example—their brain is already working overtime. The mental effort needed to process "don't" isn't available. All that registers is "fall."

**The fix:** Say what you *want* them to do, not what you want them to avoid.

### The Amygdala Problem

Two parts of the brain compete during fear:

| Part | Speed | What It Does |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Amygdala | ~12ms | Triggers fight-or-flight |
| Prefrontal Cortex | ~40ms | Reasoning, context, logic |

The amygdala is faster. When someone's scared, it can actually *block* prefrontal function. This is called "amygdala hijack." Their thinking brain is temporarily offline.

**What this means:** Logical explanations won't land when someone's scared. Simple, concrete, action-oriented language will.

### Why "Calm Down" Never Works

When someone's anxious:
- Sympathetic nervous system is active (fight-or-flight mode)
- Cortisol and adrenaline are flooding their system
- Their capacity for rational thought is physically reduced

Telling them to "calm down" is like telling someone with a broken leg to "just walk normally." The hardware is compromised.

Also: nobody who's anxious hasn't already tried to stop being anxious. "Calm down" implies they're failing at something easy. Now they're nervous *and* ashamed.

### Reactance: Humans Hate Commands

Tell people they *must* do something, and they often resist—even if they wanted to do it anyway. Psychology calls this "reactance." It produces:

- Resistance to the message
- Sometimes the opposite behavior (boomerang effect)
- Negative feelings toward you
- Less likely to comply with your next request

**High reactance:** "You have to check the ladder."
**Lower reactance:** "Here's the quick check that catches problems."

## Section 1: Phrases That Backfire (And Why)

These phrases come from good intentions. People say them because they want to help. But under stress, they often make things worse.

### "Don't fall" / "Don't drop it" / "Don't panic"

**Why people say it:** They want to warn about a danger.

**Why it doesn't work:** Activates the very thing you're warning against. The brain processes "fall" before it processes "don't."

**What happens in the trainee's mind:** Mental image of falling. Increased awareness of the possibility. For someone already nervous, this can tip them toward the outcome you're trying to prevent.

**Instead:** "Three points on the ladder." "Keep a firm grip." "We've got this."

---

### "Calm down" / "Relax" / "Just breathe"

**Why people say it:** They want to help reduce stress.

**Why it doesn't work:** Neurologically impossible when someone's in fight-or-flight. Also dismissive—implies they're failing at something they should be able to control.

**What happens in the trainee's mind:** "I'm trying to calm down. It's not working. Now I feel worse because I can't even do that right."

**Instead:** "I'm right here." "Let's take this one step at a time." "What do you need?"

---

### "There's nothing to worry about" / "It's not a big deal"

**Why people say it:** Reassurance. Trying to put things in perspective.

**Why it doesn't work:** Dismisses their feelings. If they're worried, there *is* something to worry about—to them. Telling them their feelings are wrong doesn't change the feelings; it just makes them feel unheard.

**What happens in the trainee's mind:** "You don't understand. You're not taking this seriously. I can't trust you with how I actually feel."

**Instead:** "It makes sense to be careful here." "That's a reasonable concern—let me show you how we handle it." "I get it. Let's work through this together."

---

### "You're fine" / "You've got this"

**Why people say it:** Encouragement. Confidence boost.

**Why it doesn't work:** When someone doesn't *feel* fine, being told they are can feel dismissive. "You've got this" can land as pressure rather than support.

**What happens in the trainee's mind:** "No, I'm not fine. You're not seeing what I'm experiencing." Or: "Great, now I have to live up to that expectation."

**Instead:** "I'm here if you need anything." "One move at a time." "What would help right now?"

---

### "Just..." anything

**Why people say it:** Trying to simplify. Make it seem manageable.

**Why it doesn't work:** "Just" minimizes. It implies the task is easy and the person is overcomplicating it. If it were "just" that easy, they'd have already done it.

**What happens in the trainee's mind:** "You make it sound so simple. I must be really bad at this if I can't even 'just' do it."

**Instead:** Remove "just." "Step to the next rung" instead of "Just step to the next rung." The difference is subtle but significant.

---

### "Be careful" / "Watch out"

**Why people say it:** Warning about a hazard.

**Why it doesn't work:** Too vague. Careful about what? Watch out for what? Gives no actionable information. Can actually increase anxiety without reducing risk.

**What happens in the trainee's mind:** "Careful of what? What am I missing? Now I'm looking for dangers everywhere."

**Instead:** "There's a nail sticking up by your foot." "The third rung is a little wobbly." "Watch that beam—it's lower than it looks."

---

### "You have to..." / "You need to..." / "You must..."

**Why people say it:** Emphasizing importance. Making sure they take it seriously.

**Why it doesn't work:** Commands trigger reactance. Even when people want to comply, being told they *must* creates an instinct to push back.

**What happens in the trainee's mind:** "Don't tell me what I have to do." Or resistance they might not even consciously notice.

**Instead:** "Here's what works well..." "The trick I've learned is..." "This is how [specific hazard] gets avoided."

---

### "Man up" / "Don't be such a..."

**Why people say it:** Attempting to motivate through mild shame. Often delivered as joking.

**Why it doesn't work:** Gendered language. Dismissive of real feelings. Creates an environment where people hide their concerns instead of voicing them.

**What happens in the trainee's mind:** "I can't let anyone know I'm struggling. I have to pretend to be okay." This is exactly the opposite of a safe environment.

**Instead:** Don't. There's no good alternative because the intent is the problem.

---

### The Pattern

Notice what all the "backfire" phrases have in common:

| Problem | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Negations | "Don't fall," "Don't worry" |
| Commands | "Calm down," "You have to" |
| Minimizers | "Just," "It's not a big deal" |
| Vague warnings | "Be careful," "Watch out" |
| Dismissals | "You're fine," "Nothing to worry about" |

The pattern of *effective* phrases is the opposite: positive action, specific detail, validation, respect for autonomy.

---

## Section 2: The Soft Phrases That Work

These phrases share common traits: they're specific, positive, validate the person's experience, and point toward action rather than away from danger.

### Acknowledgment Phrases

Use these when someone is clearly nervous, uncertain, or struggling. Acknowledgment isn't agreement—it's letting them know you see what they're experiencing.

| Phrase | When to Use | Tone Notes |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| "I see you're taking this seriously." | When they're being extra cautious | Validates care, not weakness |
| "That's a reasonable concern." | When they voice worry | Legitimizes without dismissing |
| "It makes sense to feel that way." | When they seem nervous | Normalizes without dwelling |
| "Heights can feel different the first few times." | Specific acknowledgment | Implies it gets easier |
| "This part trips everyone up at first." | When they make a mistake | Normalizes, implies learning |

**Variations you can make your own:**
- "First time I did this, I felt the same way."
- "That reaction is completely normal."
- "You're not the only one who's asked that."

---

### Grounding Phrases

Use these to bring someone back to the present moment and immediate task. These work by narrowing focus from "everything that could go wrong" to "the very next thing."

| Phrase | When to Use | Tone Notes |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| "Let's focus on what's right in front of us." | When they seem overwhelmed | Reduces scope |
| "One step at a time." | When task seems too big | Classic for a reason |
| "What's the very next move?" | When they're frozen | Gets them thinking concretely |
| "Right now, all we're doing is [specific action]." | When they're future-tripping | Narrows focus |
| "Let's just get to [next milestone]." | When the full task is intimidating | Breaks it down |

**The key principle:** Reduce the scope. The whole task is overwhelming; the next single action usually isn't.

---

### Confidence Phrases

Use these to reinforce capability without adding pressure. The goal is "you can do this" without "so do it already."

| Phrase | When to Use | Tone Notes |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| "You've already done the hardest part." | After they complete initial challenge | Recognizes progress |
| "You're doing exactly what you're supposed to." | When they're hesitant but correct | Validation of approach |
| "That's exactly how it's done." | After they complete a step correctly | Specific recognition |
| "You know more than you think." | When they doubt themselves | Reflects competence back |
| "Your instincts are right here." | When they're second-guessing | Trust-building |

**What to avoid:** "You've got this!" in isolation. It can feel like pressure. Pair it with specific acknowledgment: "You've already completed the setup perfectly. You've got this."

---

### Permission Phrases

Use these to explicitly give permission for things people might not feel allowed to do: pause, ask questions, take it slow.

| Phrase | When to Use | Tone Notes |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| "It's okay to take a moment." | When they're rushing nervously | Permission to slow down |
| "No rush here." | When time pressure is creating anxiety | Removes urgency |
| "You can come down whenever you need to." | On ladder, scaffold | Removes "trapped" feeling |
| "Ask as many questions as you need." | When they seem hesitant to ask | Opens the door |
| "It's fine to stop and check." | When they're uncertain | Validates caution |

**Why these work:** People often feel they should already know, should be faster, shouldn't need help. Permission phrases remove that pressure.

---

### Presence Phrases

Use these to communicate "I'm here with you" without taking over or implying they can't handle it.

| Phrase | When to Use | Tone Notes |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| "I'm right here." | When they seem isolated in their task | Not "watching"—"with" |
| "I've got the ladder." | Literal stability | Also psychological |
| "I'm not going anywhere." | When they need sustained support | Commitment |
| "We'll figure this out together." | When they're stuck | Partnership, not rescue |
| "What do you need from me?" | When you're not sure how to help | Gives them control |

**The key:** These phrases communicate support without implying incompetence.

---

### The RACE Framework

A quick mental model for responding when someone's struggling:

| Step | What | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| **R**ecognize | Notice their state | (They look nervous, hands gripping tight) |
| **A**cknowledge | Brief validation | "Ladders feel wobbly at first." |
| **C**oncrete action | Specific positive instruction | "Hands here, foot here." |
| **E**mpower | Reinforce capability | "Good. You've got it." |

This takes about 10 seconds. Recognition and acknowledgment first, *then* instruction. The instruction lands better when they feel heard.

---

## Section 3: Presence Without Pressure

Language is only part of how you communicate. Your voice, body, and timing matter just as much—sometimes more.

### Voice

| Element | What to Do | What to Avoid |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Pace** | Slow, steady | Rushed, hurried |
| **Volume** | Calm, moderate | Too loud (startling) or too quiet (straining to hear) |
| **Register** | Lower end of natural | High pitch (signals stress) |
| **Uptalk** | Avoid question inflection on statements | "You're doing great?" vs "You're doing great." |
| **Filler words** | Minimize "um," "uh" | They signal uncertainty |

**The principle:** Your voice communicates calm before your words do. If you sound stressed, they'll feel it regardless of what you're saying.

---

### Body Language

| Element | What to Do | What to Avoid |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Stance** | Open, relaxed | Arms crossed, hands in pockets |
| **Movement** | Unhurried, deliberate | Pacing, fidgeting, sudden moves |
| **Eye contact** | Regular, not constant | Staring (pressure) or avoiding (disconnection) |
| **Proximity** | Close enough to help, not crowding | Hovering over them |
| **Hands** | Visible, relaxed | Hidden, clenched |

**The principle:** Body language that says "I'm available but not anxious" gives them space to work while knowing support is there.

---

### Space and Positioning

| Situation | Positioning | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Someone on ladder | At the base, holding it | Physical stability + visible support |
| Someone using a new tool | Beside them, slightly back | Available but not hovering |
| Someone who froze | Stay where you are, don't rush in | Rushing signals emergency |
| Someone who made a mistake | Same level, facing them | Eye contact without looming |

**The principle:** Physical space communicates psychological space. Give them room to succeed while being present enough to help.

---

### Timing: When to Speak, When to Be Silent

| Situation | What to Do |
|-----------|------------|
| They're concentrating | Silent. Let them work. |
| They just completed a step | Brief acknowledgment: "Good." |
| They're stuck and looking at you | That's your cue to offer help |
| They made a small mistake | Wait. See if they self-correct. |
| They made a mistake and are frustrated | Brief acknowledgment, then redirect |
| They're panicking | Speak. Calm, simple, grounding words. |

**The principle:** Silence communicates trust. You don't need to narrate everything. When you do speak, it means more.

---

### The Goal: "I'm Here and We've Got This"

Everything in this section aims at one feeling: calm confidence.

Not "I'm watching you for mistakes."
Not "I'm worried you're going to mess up."
Not "Let me take over."

Just: "I'm here. You're capable. We've got this."

When you project that, they feel it. And feeling it helps them become it.

---

## Section 4: Practice Scenarios

These are realistic situations you might encounter. Each includes an ineffective response, effective alternatives, and why the alternatives work.

---

### Scenario 1: Trainee Freezes on Ladder

**Situation:** A volunteer is halfway up a ladder. They've stopped moving. Their knuckles are white on the rungs. They're not looking up or down.

**Ineffective response:**
> "Come on, you're almost there! Don't look down!"

**Why it doesn't work:** "Come on" adds pressure. "Don't look down" makes them think about looking down. "Almost there" dismisses the current struggle.

**Effective alternatives:**

> "I've got the ladder. It's not going anywhere."
> *(Pause. Let them breathe.)*
> "When you're ready, your right hand goes to the next rung."

**Why it works:** Physical reassurance first (the ladder is stable). No pressure ("when you're ready"). One specific, concrete instruction. You've reduced the whole task to a single hand movement.

**Another approach:**

> "Heights feel different the first few times. Totally normal."
> "I'm right here. Take all the time you need."
> "What would help right now?"

**Why it works:** Normalizes their experience. Removes time pressure. Gives them agency in finding a solution.

---

### Scenario 2: Trainee Says "I Can't Do This"

**Situation:** A volunteer is looking at a task—maybe it's using a power tool, maybe it's climbing, maybe it's lifting something heavy—and says flatly, "I can't do this."

**Ineffective response:**
> "Sure you can! It's not that hard!"

**Why it doesn't work:** Dismisses their statement. "Not that hard" implies they should find it easy. This can make them feel worse or push them to attempt something they're genuinely not ready for.

**Effective alternatives:**

> "What part feels the hardest?"

**Why it works:** Takes their statement seriously. Opens a conversation instead of closing one. Often, "I can't do this" means "one specific part of this is scary." Finding that part makes it addressable.

**If they can't articulate it:**

> "That's okay. Let's find something else you can help with right now."

**Why it works:** No shame. No pressure. They can contribute elsewhere and maybe try this later, or maybe not. Either is fine.

**If they want to try but are scared:**

> "We can break this into smaller pieces. What's the very first step, before you'd even need to [scary part]?"

**Why it works:** Makes the task less monolithic. Often, the first few steps aren't scary at all—it's the culmination that's intimidating. Getting started builds momentum.

---

### Scenario 3: Trainee Is Visibly Shaking

**Situation:** A volunteer's hands are trembling. Maybe their whole body. They're trying to hide it or push through.

**Ineffective response:**
> "Are you okay? You're shaking. Maybe you should take a break."

**Why it doesn't work:** Calling attention to the physical symptom can increase shame. "Maybe you should" makes a decision for them.

**Effective alternatives:**

> "Let's pause here for a second."
> *(Do something that gives them cover: check a measurement, look at the instructions, examine a tool.)*
> "I want to make sure we've got the right setup before we continue."

**Why it works:** Gives them a break without making it about them. The "cover story" lets them compose themselves without having to acknowledge the shaking.

**If they acknowledge it themselves:**

> "I get that. First time doing this?"
> *(If yes:)* "Makes total sense. Let's take it slow."
> *(If no:)* "Sometimes it just hits different. No rush."

**Why it works:** Normalizes without dismissing. "No rush" removes time pressure.

---

### Scenario 4: Trainee Makes a Mistake

**Situation:** A volunteer does something wrong. Maybe they cut a piece too short, dropped a tool, or failed to follow a safety protocol.

**Ineffective response:**
> "No, no, no—that's not how you do it."

**Why it doesn't work:** Triple negative. Focuses on what went wrong. Can feel like a scolding.

**Effective alternatives:**

**For a minor mistake:**
> "Here's the trick for next time: [specific correction]."

**Why it works:** Forward-focused. "Trick" frames it as useful knowledge, not failure correction.

**For a safety-related mistake:**

> "Let me show you why we do it this way."
> *(Demonstrate the correct method.)*
> "The reason is [specific hazard]. Make sense?"

**Why it works:** Shows rather than tells. Explains the why. Ends with a check-in that gives them a chance to ask questions.

**For a mistake they're upset about:**

> "Happens to everyone. I've done the same thing."
> "The good news is [how to recover/what's not ruined/what we can do]."

**Why it works:** Normalizes. Shifts focus from the error to the path forward.

---

### Scenario 5: Group Getting Tense

**Situation:** It's late in the day, things have gone wrong, and the whole group is stressed. You can feel tension in how people are talking (or not talking) to each other.

**Ineffective response:**
> "Okay everyone, let's all just calm down and focus."

**Why it doesn't work:** "Calm down" to an entire group works no better than to an individual. Pointing out the tension can amplify it.

**Effective alternatives:**

> "Let's take five. Grab some water, stretch, we'll regroup."

**Why it works:** Physical break disrupts the stress pattern. Simple, actionable, no blame.

**When you come back:**

> "Okay. What's the one thing we need to get done in the next twenty minutes?"

**Why it works:** Narrows focus. "One thing" is manageable. Specific time frame makes it feel achievable.

**If conflict is brewing between people:**

> "[Person A], can you help me with something over here for a second?"
> *(Physically separate them. Private conversation if needed.)*

**Why it works:** Removes the audience. Gives everyone a chance to reset without a public confrontation.

## Integrating With Your Tone Style

The principles here work with any of our communication styles:

**Straight Talk:** Be direct—but direct about what to *do*, not what to avoid.
> ~~"Don't rush this."~~ → "Take your time with this."

**Been There:** Your stories already validate. Add specific acknowledgment.
> "First time up there, my legs were jelly too. Here's what helped me..."

**Let's Figure It Out:** Natural autonomy support. The phrases here just make it explicit.
> "What do you think you'd need to feel steady here?"

**Real Consequences:** Validation through honesty.
> "People get nervous about this for good reason. The drop is real. That's why we [specific safety measure]."

**Quick Hits:** Keep it positive and concrete. These formats force specificity.
> "Hands here. Foot there. Good."

---

## Final Thought

You don't need to memorize all of this. Here's what matters:

1. **Say what you want, not what you don't want.** "Three points" instead of "Don't fall."

2. **Validate first, instruct second.** They'll hear you better once they feel heard.

3. **Be specific.** "Watch the nail by your foot" beats "be careful."

4. **Your presence matters as much as your words.** Calm breeds calm.

Pick one or two phrases that feel natural to you. Use them. They'll become automatic. Then pick another.

The goal isn't perfect language. It's language that doesn't accidentally make things worse—and occasionally makes things better.
