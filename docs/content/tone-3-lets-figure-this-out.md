## Introduction / Welcome

**Your First Day - Let's Figure This Out**

Okay, so it's your first day. You're probably wondering: what am I actually supposed to do? And how do I not mess anything up?

Totally fair questions. Let's think through this together.

First thing: this is a volunteer site. Nobody expects you to be a construction expert. That's not why you're here. You're here to help, and the experienced folks here will show you what to do.

Second: safety rules. There are a lot of them, and they can feel overwhelming. But here's the thing - they're not random. Each one exists because someone got hurt doing it the other way. So they're worth paying attention to, even when they seem like overkill.

The big three to remember today:
1. If you don't know, ask
2. If it feels unsafe, stop
3. Wear your gear

That's really it for now. The rest will come as you go.

Ready?

## PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)

**PPE - Let's Figure This Out**

Okay, so PPE - Personal Protective Equipment. What actually matters here?

Let's break it down:

**Hard hat** - This one's about physics. If you're in an area where something could fall on you, or you could hit your head, hard hat goes on. It's not about looking the part - it's about your skull being softer than most construction materials.

**Safety glasses** - Any time there's cutting, drilling, hammering, or anything that could send particles flying, glasses on. "But I'll be careful" isn't a substitute - debris doesn't care how careful you are.

**Gloves** - Splinters, chemicals in treated wood, sharp edges. Your hands are important. Protect them. Different tasks need different gloves though - ask if you're not sure.

**Footwear** - Closed-toe, sturdy. Things get dropped. Things get stepped on. Sandals are not it.

Here's the mental model: each piece of PPE protects against a specific hazard. Match the gear to the hazard, and you're good.

The main mistake people make? Having the gear but not actually wearing it. Glasses on your head don't protect your eyes.

Makes sense?

## Ladder Safety

**Ladders - Let's Figure This Out**

Okay, so ladders - why do we make such a big deal about them? They're just... ladders, right?

Here's the thing: ladder falls are a leading cause of construction injuries. And it's almost never dramatic stuff like falling off a roof. It's stepping off a regular ladder from 6 feet up and landing wrong. Breaking a wrist. Tweaking a back. Stuff that could have been avoided.

So let's break it down. Why do people fall off ladders?

1. **The ladder kicks out at the base.** Solution: Someone holds it. Simple.
2. **They reach too far and lose balance.** Solution: If your belt buckle goes past the side rails, stop. Come down. Move the ladder.
3. **They're moving too fast with too few handholds.** Solution: Three points of contact, always. Two hands one foot, or two feet one hand.

The top step thing - that one's about physics. The top step doesn't give you anything to grab if you start to wobble. It's there to hold, not to stand on.

Makes sense? The good news is ladder safety is mostly just *not rushing*. Take the extra 30 seconds.

## Manual Handling / Lifting

**Lifting - Let's Figure This Out**

So all the lifting rules - bend your knees, keep it close, don't twist - they make sense in theory. But let's actually think about why.

**Bend your knees, not your back.** Why? Your leg muscles are way stronger than your back muscles. When you bend at the waist to pick something up, your back is doing all the work. When you squat, your legs are.

**Keep it close to your body.** Why? Physics again - leverage. The farther something is from your center, the more force it takes to hold it. Same weight feels lighter when it's close.

**Don't twist while carrying.** Why? Your spine doesn't like rotating under load. Turn with your feet instead.

But here's the thing that underlies all of that: **if it feels too heavy, it is.** Your body knows. You don't need a chart to tell you. If your gut says "this is too much," listen to it.

The fix is simple: get help. Two people can move almost anything safely that one person might struggle with.

So the real rule isn't about technique - it's about being honest with yourself about what you can actually handle.

## Tool Safety

**Tools - Let's Figure This Out**

Tools. There are a lot of them, and they all have different quirks. But let's think about what they all have in common when it comes to safety.

**Sharp things cut.** Whether it's a saw, a chisel, or a utility knife, the principle is the same: keep the sharp edge away from your body and know where your fingers are. Always.

**Moving things need to stop safely.** Power tools especially - they have momentum. Even hand tools like hammers have momentum. You need to know where that momentum is going if something slips.

**Things need to be secured.** If you're cutting something, it shouldn't be able to move unexpectedly. That's what clamps are for. Or another person holding it. The piece you're working on should be the thing that doesn't move.

So before picking up any tool, think about:
- What could go wrong with this tool?
- Where should my hands be?
- Is my work secured?
- Am I wearing the right protection?

If you're not sure about any of those, ask someone. That's not weakness - that's thinking ahead.

## Situational Awareness

**Awareness - Let's Figure This Out**

Situational awareness sounds fancy, but it's really just: know what's going on around you.

Why does this matter on a construction site? Because things are always changing. Someone starts using a power tool behind you. Someone sets up a ladder where you were planning to walk. Cords get strung across areas. Debris accumulates.

So let's break it down into practical habits:

**Before you start a task:** Look around. Who's near you? What's above you? Where are the cords and debris? Are you about to do something that could affect others?

**While you're working:** Check in periodically. Has anything changed? Did someone move into your space?

**When you move:** Announce yourself - "Coming through," "Behind you." Look before walking into new areas. Don't assume it's the same as it was an hour ago.

The mental model is like driving: check your mirrors. Not because you're paranoid, but because you're aware that things change and you might need to adjust.

It becomes automatic after a while. But at first, you have to consciously remind yourself.

## Closing / End of Day

**End of Day - Let's Figure This Out**

So the day's almost done. What should we think about before we leave?

**Clean your area.** Why? Because what you leave behind could be a hazard for someone else tomorrow. Or for the first person on site in the morning. Trip hazards, tools left in the wrong places, debris - clean it up.

**Return tools.** Why? Because a tool that's not where it's supposed to be is a tool someone else can't find. Or worse, a tool someone could trip over.

**Report anything weird.** If you noticed something that didn't seem right - a damaged tool, a close call, a confusing situation - mention it to a supervisor. You're not getting anyone in trouble. You're preventing problems.

The site at the end of the day should be set up for success tomorrow.

Sound good? Good work today.
