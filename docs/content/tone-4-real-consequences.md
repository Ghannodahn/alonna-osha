## Introduction / Welcome

**Your First Day - Real Consequences**

Welcome. Before we get started, I want to be honest with you about something.

Construction sites - even volunteer ones - have real hazards. People get hurt. Not often, and not if we're careful, but it happens. Cuts, falls, back injuries.

I'm not saying this to scare you. I'm saying it because the safety stuff we're about to cover isn't bureaucracy. It's not rules for the sake of rules. Every guideline we have exists because someone, somewhere, got hurt doing it a different way.

The good news: almost every injury is preventable. The people who get hurt are usually the ones who skipped a step, rushed, or thought "it won't happen to me."

Today, pay attention to the safety stuff. Not because you have to - because it actually matters.

Let's have a good, safe day.

## PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)

**PPE - Real Consequences**

Let me tell you what PPE actually protects you from:

**Hard hat:** Head injuries on construction sites range from minor bumps to traumatic brain injuries. Low beams, falling tools, swinging lumber - your skull is softer than all of them. The hat isn't about looking professional. It's about your brain.

**Safety glasses:** Eye injuries from construction debris are common and often permanent. A flying wood chip, a splash of dust, a piece of metal - it takes one particle to damage your vision forever. "I'll be careful" isn't protection.

**Gloves:** Splinters get infected. Treated lumber contains chemicals that absorb through your skin. Deep cuts from sharp materials can damage tendons. Your hands are how you do everything. Protect them.

**Footwear:** Dropped materials, stepped-on nails, crush injuries. People have broken toes, punctured feet. Boots with hard toes prevent the most common injuries.

Here's the thing: PPE only works if you wear it correctly, every time. The people who get hurt often *had* the gear. They just weren't wearing it in that moment.

"Just for a second" is when it happens.

## Ladder Safety

**Ladders - Real Consequences**

Falls from ladders kill construction workers every year. Not falls from buildings or scaffolds - falls from ladders.

And the ones that don't kill can still end your day badly. Broken wrists from catching yourself. Twisted ankles from an awkward landing. Back injuries that take months to heal.

Most of these falls are from under 10 feet. That's not even that high. But it's high enough.

Here's how you don't become a statistic:

**Have someone hold the base.** This isn't paranoia - it's the single most effective thing you can do. Ladders don't fall at the top; they kick out at the bottom.

**Keep 3 points on the ladder.** Always. Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand. The second you're down to two points, you're one lean away from losing balance.

**Don't use the top step.** It's not designed as a step. It's there so you have something to grab. Stand on it, and when you wobble - and you will - you've got nothing.

You came here to help build something. Going home injured doesn't help anyone. Take the extra minute.

## Manual Handling / Lifting

**Lifting - Real Consequences**

Back injuries don't always heal. I want you to understand that.

Some people tweak their back lifting something wrong and they're fine in a week. Some people do the same thing and deal with chronic pain for years. There's no way to know ahead of time which you'll be.

Your spine is not designed to be a crane. The discs between your vertebrae can bulge, herniate, rupture. The muscles around them can tear. And unlike a cut or a bruise, back injuries often come back, again and again.

Here's the rule: **if it feels too heavy, it is.** Your body knows before your ego does. There's no prize for lifting more than you should.

The technique stuff matters:
- Lift with your legs, not your back
- Keep the load close
- Don't twist under load

But even perfect technique won't save you from lifting something that's too heavy for you.

Ask for help. Use a dolly. Make two trips. Whatever it takes. Your back is the only one you've got, and you need it for the rest of your life.

## Tool Safety

**Tools - Real Consequences**

Every tool on a construction site is capable of causing injury. Not as a worst-case scenario - as a pretty straightforward outcome of using it wrong.

**Cutting tools** - Saws, knives, chisels - will cut you the same way they cut wood. A utility knife slip can go through skin, fat, muscle, tendon. Deep cuts may require surgery. Some people lose function in their fingers permanently.

**Hammering** - Crushed fingertips. Broken fingers. The occasional eye injury from flying debris. None of these are rare.

**Power tools** - Anything with a motor multiplies the force involved. A circular saw can take off a finger in under a second. Not enough time to react. Not enough time to think "oh no."

This isn't to scare you off from using tools. It's to make you respect them.

The people who get hurt usually made one of these mistakes:
- Didn't secure the work (it shifted, hand got in the way)
- Rushed
- Weren't paying attention to where their hands were
- Used the tool for something it wasn't meant for

Five seconds of focus before each use. That's all it takes.

## Situational Awareness

**Awareness - Real Consequences**

Here's how accidents happen on construction sites: someone focused so hard on their own task that they didn't notice what was changing around them.

They step back into a cord and trip. They walk under a ladder someone's on. They start swinging a hammer without checking who's behind them.

Construction sites are dynamic. Things move. People move. What was clear a minute ago might have a hazard now.

The volunteers who stay safe are the ones who keep updating their mental picture of the site. They look around before starting a task. They announce themselves when moving. They don't assume.

It takes about five seconds to scan your surroundings. That's it.

The alternative is being surprised - by a cord you trip over, a tool that swings into you, a ladder that bumps you. Surprises on construction sites tend to hurt.

Stay aware. It's the cheapest insurance there is.

## Closing / End of Day

**End of Day - Real Consequences**

Before you leave, think about who's coming to this site tomorrow.

If you leave debris on the ground, someone could trip on it.
If you leave a tool in a weird spot, someone could step on it or knock it over.
If you don't mention that damaged tool, someone might use it tomorrow and get hurt.

The cleanup at the end of the day isn't housekeeping for its own sake. It's making sure the site is safe for the next person. That next person might be you.

Did anything seem off today? Tool acting weird? Close call? Confusing situation? Tell a supervisor. Not to get anyone in trouble - to prevent something worse from happening next time.

You did good work today. Go home safe. That's the goal, every day.
