## Design Patterns Observed

### What Works
- Visual-heavy tool identification
- Clear restricted tool markings
- Numbered rules for memorability
- Time allocations for instructors

### What's Missing
- Visual aids for safety procedures
- Scenario-based learning
- Quick-reference cards
- Consequence/rationale explanations

## Errata Integration Points

Based on structure, errata should be designed to:

1. **Supplement Section 4** - Most errata will expand safety rules
2. **Add Visual Safety Guides** - Match the visual style of tool pages
3. **Provide Quick Reference** - Condensed safety cards for jobsite use
4. **Include Scenarios** - "What if..." situations not covered

### Recommended Errata Placement

| Errata Topic | Insert After |
|--------------|--------------|
| Job Hazard Analysis | Page 9 (before safety rules) |
| PPE Deep Dive | Page 9 (after PPE list) |
| Ladder Safety Extended | Page 12 |
| Power Tool Specifics | Page 11 |
| Emergency Procedures | Page 13 (new final section) |
| Working at Heights | Page 12 |
| Heat/Cold Safety | Page 10 (personal safety) |

## Formatting Standards (for Errata Consistency)

Based on manual style:

| Element | Format |
|---------|--------|
| Section Headers | UNDERLINED, ALL CAPS |
| Subsection Headers | **Bold** |
| Rules | Numbered list |
| Tools | Lettered list (A, B, C) |
