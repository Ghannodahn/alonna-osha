## Introduction / Welcome

**Your First Day - Straight Talk**

Hey. Welcome to the site. Here's what you need to know: we want you to go home the same way you came in. No ER trips, no injuries, no stories about "that one time."

Safety rules exist because someone got hurt. That's it. Not bureaucracy - history.

You'll hear a lot today. Remember three things:
1. Wear your PPE
2. Ask if you're unsure
3. Trust your gut - if it feels unsafe, it is

Let's get to work.

## PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)

**PPE - Straight Talk**

PPE isn't optional. Here's what you need and when:

**Always on site:**
- Hard hat (in active work areas)
- Safety glasses (anytime you're near cutting, nailing, or demolition)
- Closed-toe shoes (boots preferred)

**Task-specific:**
- Gloves - when handling rough materials, treated lumber, or insulation
- Ear protection - when using or near power tools
- Dust mask - when cutting treated wood, working with fiberglass, or in dusty conditions

The gear works only if you wear it correctly. Glasses on your face, not on your head. Hard hat level, not tilted back.

"It's uncomfortable" isn't an excuse. Splinters in your eye are more uncomfortable.

## Ladder Safety

**Ladders - Straight Talk**

Ladders. Here's the deal: falls from ladders send more volunteers to the ER than anything else on our sites. Not falls from roofs - falls from regular ladders, usually under 10 feet.

Three things keep you safe:

1. **Have someone hold the base.** Every time. No exceptions.
2. **Keep three points on the ladder** - two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand. Always.
3. **Stay centered.** If your belt buckle goes past the rails, you're overreaching. Come down and move the ladder.

One more thing: the top step isn't a step. It's a handhold. Stand on it and you've got nothing to grab when you wobble.

Takes 30 extra seconds to do it right. That's cheaper than an ambulance ride.

## Manual Handling / Lifting

**Lifting - Straight Talk**

Here's the one lifting rule that matters: if it feels too heavy, it is.

Your back knows. Listen to it. Ask for help or find another way.

Beyond that:
- Lift with your legs, not your back
- Keep the load close to your body
- Don't twist - move your feet instead
- Plan where you're going before you pick it up

No one here is impressed by how much you can carry. We're impressed by people who ask for help when they need it.

## Tool Safety

**Tools - Straight Talk**

Tools. Basic rules:

**Before using:**
- Inspect it. Damaged tools cause injuries.
- Know what it's for. Use it for that, nothing else.
- If you don't know how to use it, ask.

**While using:**
- Cut away from your body
- Secure your work (clamp it, have someone hold it)
- Know where your fingers are relative to the blade. Always.

**Power tools:**
- On this site, ask before using power tools
- If you're not comfortable, say so. That's not weakness - that's smart.

The tool doesn't care if you're experienced. Respect it.

## Situational Awareness

**Awareness - Straight Talk**

Construction sites change constantly. What was safe an hour ago might not be now.

Before you start any task:
- Look around. Who's nearby? What's overhead?
- Where are the cords, hoses, debris?
- Is anyone about to walk into your work area?

Moving around the site:
- Announce yourself: "Coming through," "Behind you"
- Don't walk under ladders or scaffold without checking
- Watch where you step. Every time.

If you're focused so hard on your task that you've lost track of your surroundings, stop. Reset. Look around.

## Closing / End of Day

**End of Day - Straight Talk**

Before you leave:
1. Put tools back where they belong
2. Clean up your work area
3. Report anything that seems off - damaged equipment, near misses, anything

Tomorrow, someone else might work where you worked today. Leave it safe for them.

Good work today. See you tomorrow.
