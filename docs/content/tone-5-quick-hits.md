## Introduction / Welcome

**First Day - Quick Hits**

Three things to remember:

1. **Ask** if you don't know
2. **Stop** if it feels unsafe
3. **Wear your gear**

Questions to a supervisor anytime. No one expects you to know everything.

Let's go.

## PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)

**PPE - Quick Hits**

| Always | When |
|--------|------|
| Safety glasses | Cutting, drilling, hammering |
| Hard hat | Active work areas |
| Closed-toe shoes | Always |
| Gloves | Rough materials, treated wood |
| Ear protection | Power tools nearby |

**The rule:** Match the gear to the hazard. Wear it correctly.

Glasses on face, not head. Hard hat level, not tilted.

## Ladder Safety

**Ladders - Quick Hits**

30 seconds. Ladder safety:

1. **Someone holds the base.** Always.
2. **3 points on the ladder.** Two hands + foot, or two feet + hand.
3. **Belt buckle between the rails.** Past the rails = overreaching = move the ladder.
4. **Top step is for holding, not standing.**

Ladder falls are a leading cause of construction injuries. These four things prevent almost all of them.

## Manual Handling / Lifting

**Lifting - Quick Hits**

**The rule:** If it feels too heavy, it is. Get help.

Technique:
- Legs, not back
- Load close to body
- Don't twist - move your feet

No prizes for carrying too much. Ask for a hand.

---

## Tool Safety

**Tools - Quick Hits**

Before using:
1. **Inspect** - anything damaged?
2. **Secure** - is the work clamped?
3. **Position** - where are your hands relative to the blade?

While using:
- Cut away from body
- If you don't know, ask

**Power tools:** Always ask before using on this site.

---

## Situational Awareness

**Awareness - Quick Hits**

Before starting: **Look around.**
- Who's nearby?
- What's overhead?
- Where are the cords?

Moving around:
- "Coming through" / "Behind you"
- Don't walk under ladders
- Watch your step

If you lose track of your surroundings, stop and reset.

## Working at Heights / Above-Below

**Above/Below - Quick Hits**

If you're above:
- Secure everything
- Nothing drops without "HEADS UP"

If you're below:
- Hard hat on
- Look up before entering zones

**Drop zones:** Stay out until cleared.

---

## End of Day

**End of Day - Quick Hits**

Before you leave:
1. Tools put away
2. Area cleaned
3. Report anything weird

Site clean = site safe tomorrow.

Good work.
