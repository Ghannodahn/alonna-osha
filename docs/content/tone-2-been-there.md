## Introduction / Welcome

**Your First Day - Been There**

Hey, welcome to your first day. I remember mine - excited to help, a little nervous, not totally sure what I was doing. Totally normal.

Here's something I wish someone had told me: nobody expects you to know everything. That's not why you're here. You're here to help, and part of helping is asking questions and staying safe while you learn.

I made plenty of mistakes my first few times on site. Wore the wrong shoes (learned that one fast). Tried to lift something way too heavy by myself. Walked right under a ladder someone was on. Nothing terrible happened, but any of those could have gone sideways.

The experienced folks here have seen it all. Use them. Ask questions. That's what they're here for.

Let's have a good day.

## PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)

**PPE - Been There**

I'll be honest - when I started, I thought PPE was overkill. Hard hat? Safety glasses? Seemed like a lot of fuss.

Then I was on a site where a piece of scrap flew off a saw and hit a guy's cheek. An inch higher and he'd have lost an eye. He was wearing safety glasses and walked away with a bruise instead of an injury.

That changed my thinking.

Here's what I've learned to always have ready:
- **Hard hat** - Not just for things falling on you. I've hit my head on low beams more times than I care to admit.
- **Safety glasses** - Anytime there's cutting, nailing, or anything that could send debris flying. Dust counts too.
- **Gloves** - Splinters are real. Treated lumber leaves chemicals on your skin.
- **Good shoes** - I dropped a piece of lumber on my foot once. Steel toes would've saved me two weeks of limping.

The first time PPE saves you from something, you stop thinking of it as a hassle.

## Ladder Safety

**Ladders - Been There**

First time I used a ladder on a build, nobody told me about the three-point rule. I was carrying a piece of trim, had one hand on it, one hand on a rung, and I was moving fast. I didn't fall, but I came close enough that my heart was pounding.

Here's what I learned that day:

The reason they say "3-point contact" is because that's your stability. Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand - always. The moment you've only got two points, you're one shift away from trouble.

Also? Have someone hold the base. I know it feels silly to ask. I used to think "I'm just going up for a second." But ladders kick out at the base, not at the top. Someone holding it takes that risk away entirely.

And the top step - I know it's tempting when you're *almost* tall enough. But it's there so you have something to hold, not stand on. Come down, get a taller ladder, or move it closer. Your knees will thank you.

Trust me on this one.

## Manual Handling / Lifting

**Lifting - Been There**

I used to try to "hero" everything - carry more, prove I could handle it. Then I spent two weeks unable to bend over after trying to move a stack of shingles by myself. Wasn't worth it.

Now my rule is simple: if it feels too heavy, it is. No shame in asking for a hand.

The lifting technique stuff - lift with your legs, keep it close to your body, don't twist - that all makes sense once you feel the difference. Try lifting a heavy box the wrong way (bending at the waist) and then the right way (squatting, keeping your back straight). Your back will tell you which one's better.

And here's something nobody told me: it's not just weight that matters. Awkward shapes are just as hard. A sheet of plywood isn't that heavy, but by yourself? Nightmare. Two people makes it easy.

Ask for help. Seriously. Your back is the only one you've got.

## Tool Safety

**Tools - Been There**

When I was new, I didn't inspect tools before using them. Why would I? They came out of the tool box, they must be fine.

Then I grabbed a hammer with a loose head. First swing, the head flew off and hit the wall. Could've hit me. Could've hit the person next to me.

Now I check. Takes five seconds:
- Does anything wobble that shouldn't?
- Is the blade sharp and straight?
- If it's got a cord, is the cord frayed?

The other thing I learned: secure your work. I used to hold things with one hand and cut with the other. Saved time, right? Until the piece shifted and I nearly cut myself.

Now I clamp things. Or I ask someone to hold them. Takes a little longer, but I've still got all my fingers.

Oh, and cutting - always away from your body. I know it seems obvious, but when you're tired and rushing, it's easy to forget. I've got a small scar on my thumb that reminds me.

## Situational Awareness

**Awareness - Been There**

I was on a ladder once, focused on my task, and someone walked right under me without saying anything. I was holding a drill at the time. If I'd dropped it...

Now I always announce myself when I'm moving around. "Coming through." "Behind you." "Walking under the scaffold." It feels weird at first, but it's just what you do on a site.

The other thing: I've tripped over more cords and lumber than I care to admit. Usually when I was focused on something else and not watching where I was stepping.

My fix: whenever I enter a new area, I stop for a second and look around. Where are the hazards? Who's working nearby? Any cords or debris in my path?

It's like checking your mirrors when you drive. You do it automatically after a while.

## Closing / End of Day

**End of Day - Been There**

I used to leave my area kind of messy at the end of the day. "Someone will clean it up" or "I'll get it tomorrow."

Then one morning I came back to a tripping hazard I'd left the night before. Could've hurt someone.

Now I spend the last five minutes of every day cleaning up. Tools put away. Scrap in the bin. Work area clear.

Partly it's about safety. Partly it's about respect - the next person to work in that spot shouldn't have to deal with my mess.

If you noticed anything today that seemed off - damaged tool, close call, confusing situation - mention it to a supervisor. Not to get anyone in trouble. Just to make tomorrow safer.

You did good today.
