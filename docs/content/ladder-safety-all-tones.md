# Ladder Safety - All Five Peer-to-Peer Tones

## Core Message to Convey

**Key facts**:
- Falls from ladders are a leading cause of construction injuries
- Most falls are from under 10 feet - not dramatic heights
- 3-point contact prevents most falls
- Having someone hold the base prevents most tip-overs
- The top step isn't for standing

## Tone 1: Straight Talk

**Ladder Safety - Straight Talk**

Ladders. Here's the deal: falls from ladders send more volunteers to the ER than anything else on our sites. Not falls from roofs - falls from regular ladders, usually under 10 feet.

Three things keep you safe:

1. **Have someone hold the base.** Every time. No exceptions.
2. **Keep three points on the ladder** - two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand. Always.
3. **Stay centered.** If your belt buckle goes past the rails, you're overreaching. Come down and move the ladder.

One more thing: the top step isn't a step. It's a handhold. Stand on it and you've got nothing to grab when you wobble.

Takes 30 extra seconds to do it right. That's cheaper than an ambulance ride.

## Tone 2: Been There

**Ladder Safety - Been There**

First time I used a ladder on a build, nobody told me about the three-point rule. I was carrying a piece of trim, had one hand on it, one hand on a rung, and I was moving fast. I didn't fall, but I came close enough that my heart was pounding.

Here's what I learned that day:

The reason they say "3-point contact" is because that's your stability. Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand - always. The moment you've only got two points, you're one shift away from trouble.

Also? Have someone hold the base. I know it feels silly to ask. I used to think "I'm just going up for a second." But ladders kick out at the base, not at the top. Someone holding it takes that risk away entirely.

And the top step - I know it's tempting when you're *almost* tall enough. But it's there so you have something to hold, not stand on. Come down, get a taller ladder, or move it closer. Your knees will thank you.

## Tone 3: Let's Figure This Out

**Ladder Safety - Let's Figure This Out**

Okay, so ladders - why do we make such a big deal about them? They're just... ladders, right?

Here's the thing: ladder falls are a leading cause of construction injuries. And it's almost never dramatic stuff like falling off a roof. It's stepping off a regular ladder from 6 feet up and landing wrong. Breaking a wrist. Tweaking a back. Stuff that could have been avoided.

So let's break it down. Why do people fall off ladders?

1. **The ladder kicks out at the base.** Solution: Someone holds it. Simple.
2. **They reach too far and lose balance.** Solution: If your belt buckle goes past the side rails, stop. Come down. Move the ladder.
3. **They're moving too fast with too few handholds.** Solution: Three points of contact, always. Two hands one foot, or two feet one hand.

The top step thing - that one's about physics. The top step doesn't give you anything to grab if you start to wobble. It's there to hold, not to stand on.

Makes sense? The good news is ladder safety is mostly just *not rushing*. Take the extra 30 seconds.

## Tone 4: Real Consequences

**Ladder Safety - Real Consequences**

Falls from ladders kill construction workers every year. Not falls from buildings or scaffolds - falls from ladders.

And the ones that don't kill can still end your day badly. Broken wrists from catching yourself. Twisted ankles from an awkward landing. Back injuries that take months to heal.

Most of these falls are from under 10 feet. That's not even that high. But it's high enough.

Here's how you don't become a statistic:

**Have someone hold the base.** This isn't paranoia - it's the single most effective thing you can do. Ladders don't fall at the top; they kick out at the bottom.

**Keep 3 points on the ladder.** Always. Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand. The second you're down to two points, you're one lean away from losing balance.

**Don't use the top step.** It's not designed as a step. It's there so you have something to grab. Stand on it, and when you wobble - and you will - you've got nothing.

You came here to help build something. Going home injured doesn't help anyone. Take the extra minute.

## Tone 5: Quick Hits

**Ladder Safety - Quick Hits**

30 seconds. Ladder safety:

1. **Someone holds the base.** Always.
2. **3 points on the ladder.** Two hands + foot, or two feet + hand.
3. **Belt buckle between the rails.** Past the rails = overreaching = move the ladder.
4. **Top step is for holding, not standing.**

Ladder falls are a leading cause of construction injuries. These four things prevent almost all of them.

## Comparison: Original vs. Peer-to-Peer

| Original (Building Beyond the Walls) | Peer-to-Peer Version |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| "Building Beyond the Walls requires a second person to hold the ladder" | "Someone holds the base. Always." |
| "Always maintain a 3-point (two hands and a foot or two feet and a hand) contact on the ladder while climbing" | "3 points on the ladder - that's your stability" |
| "Do not use the top step/rung of a ladder as a step/rung unless it was designed for that purpose" | "Top step is for holding, not standing" |
| "Keep your body within the side rails. Never over reach." | "Belt buckle past the rails? You're overreaching. Move the ladder." |
