# Heat Safety — Water, Rest, Shade

**Erratum ID:** ERR-GAP-005

## The Gap

The manual has zero coverage of heat-related hazards.

This matters because:
- 50-70% of outdoor heat fatalities occur in the first few days of working in hot conditions
- New volunteers—people without heat acclimatization—are at highest risk
- Heat illness escalates fast: you can go from "a little tired" to medical emergency in under an hour

## A Been There Moment

It was maybe 85 degrees. Not that hot, I thought. I'd been working for a couple hours, stayed focused on the task. Didn't want to be the one taking breaks.

Then I noticed I'd stopped sweating. That felt wrong. Sat down for a minute, couldn't remember what I was doing before I sat down.

Someone got me water and shade. I was fine—but I'd been heading toward heat exhaustion without realizing it. The scary part? I felt totally normal until I didn't.

Now I drink water whether I'm thirsty or not. I take breaks in the shade even when I don't think I need them. Because by the time you feel it, you're already behind.

## The Three Rules

### Water

Drink before you're thirsty. Once you feel thirsty, you're already dehydrated.

| Condition | How Much |
|-----------|----------|
| Moderate heat | 1 cup every 15-20 minutes |
| High heat or heavy work | 1 cup every 10-15 minutes |

Not soda. Not energy drinks. Water. (Sports drinks are okay occasionally but water is what you need.)

### Rest

Take breaks before you're exhausted.

| Condition | Break Frequency |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Under 80°F | Regular work rhythm, breaks as needed |
| 80-90°F | Break every 30-45 minutes in shade |
| Over 90°F | Break every 20-30 minutes in shade |
| Heat index over 100°F | Consider stopping or significantly reducing work |

Your first few days working in heat? Take more breaks. Your body needs time to adjust.

### Shade

When you rest, get out of the sun completely. Not partial shade—real shade.

If natural shade isn't available, ask about:
- Canopy tents
- Vehicle interiors (with AC on or windows down)
- Indoor spaces

## Warning Signs

### Heat Exhaustion

Your body is overheating but can still recover with intervention.

| Symptom | What It Looks Like |
|---------|-------------------|
| Heavy sweating | More than seems normal |
| Cold, pale, clammy skin | Despite the heat |
| Weak, rapid pulse | |
| Nausea or vomiting | |
| Muscle cramps | |
| Fatigue, weakness | |
| Dizziness | |
| Headache | |

**What to do:**
1. Move to shade/cool area immediately
2. Lie down with legs elevated
3. Apply cool, wet cloths to skin
4. Sip water (small amounts)
5. Get medical help if symptoms worsen or don't improve in 30 minutes

### Heat Stroke — MEDICAL EMERGENCY

The body can no longer regulate temperature. This is life-threatening.

| Symptom | What It Looks Like |
|---------|-------------------|
| High body temperature | 103°F+ (they feel hot to touch) |
| Hot, red, dry skin | **Stopped sweating** |
| Rapid, strong pulse | |
| Confusion | Disoriented, not making sense |
| Unconsciousness | |

**What to do:**
1. **Call 911 immediately**
2. Move person to coolest available area
3. Cool them however you can (water, ice, fanning, wet sheets)
4. **Do NOT give them fluids** if unconscious or confused
5. Stay with them until help arrives

## Who's Most at Risk

- **New to heat work** — first few days of hot-weather volunteering
- **Not acclimated** — haven't been working outdoors regularly
- **Taking certain medications** — some affect heat tolerance (ask your doctor)
- **Certain health conditions** — heart conditions, diabetes, etc.
- **Didn't sleep well** — fatigue reduces heat tolerance
- **Hungover or dehydrated** — starting behind

If any of these apply to you, take extra water breaks and watch yourself more closely.

## Quick Reference

| | What To Do |
|---|------------|
| **Prevention** | Water every 15-20 min. Shade breaks every 30-45 min in heat. |
| **Heat Exhaustion** | Shade, lie down, cool cloths, sip water. Get help if not improving. |
| **Heat Stroke** | **911 NOW.** Cool them aggressively. Don't give fluids if confused. |

## The Permission

Nobody will think less of you for:
- Taking a water break
- Sitting in the shade
- Saying "I need to cool down"

What they will think less of is someone who pushes through warning signs and ends up in an ambulance.

**If it's hot and you feel off—say something.** That's not weakness. That's intelligence.
