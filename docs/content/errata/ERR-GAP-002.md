# Fall Protection — The 6-Foot Rule and Beyond

## The Gap

The manual covers ladder safety but stops there. It doesn't address:
- What happens when you're working at height but not on a ladder
- The "6-foot rule" — when OSHA requires fall protection
- Edges, holes, and openings that could lead to falls
- What to do when guardrails are present (or should be)

Falls are the #1 cause of construction fatalities — 39% of deaths. Most happen at heights that don't seem that dangerous.

## The 6-Foot Rule

If you're working 6 feet or more above the level below, fall protection is required.

That sounds high. It's not. Think about:
- Second-story work
- Flat roof access
- Some scaffold platforms
- Elevated walkways

Six feet doesn't seem far until you fall. At 6 feet, you hit the ground before you can react. That's enough to break bones, crack skulls, end careers.

**Rule:** If you're at 6 feet or more and there's no guardrail or other protection—don't be there. Ask your site lead how to do the work safely or whether you should be doing it at all.

## A Been There Moment

I was helping on a roof—not high up, maybe 8 feet at the edge. The roof was flat, the day was nice, felt completely safe.

Then I stepped back to look at what we'd done and almost walked right off the edge. Caught myself with about a foot to spare.

What saved me? Someone had put up caution tape at the edge. Not a guardrail—just tape. But it was enough to make me notice where I was.

After that, I started paying attention to edges. Flat roofs feel safe until they aren't. You get focused on the work, forget where you are. That's how falls happen.

## Hazards Beyond Ladders

### Edges

Any edge you can fall from:
- Roof edges (flat or sloped)
- Scaffold edges without guardrails
- Open floors in multi-story construction
- Loading docks

**What to look for:** 39 inches of solid barrier (standard guardrail height) or stay back from the edge.

### Floor Holes

Openings in floors or walking surfaces:
- Stairwell openings before stairs are installed
- Holes cut for HVAC or plumbing
- Removed panels

**Rule:** If there's a hole, it should be covered and marked, or guarded. If you see an unprotected hole, don't go near it—tell your site lead.

### Skylights

Skylights look solid but often can't support your weight.

**Rule:** Treat skylights like holes. Don't walk on them, don't lean on them, don't set anything on them.

## Scaffolds (If Used on Your Site)

Volunteer sites sometimes use scaffolding. If you encounter one:

| Before You Climb | Ask |
|------------------|-----|
| Has it been inspected? | Someone qualified should check it each day |
| Are the guardrails in place? | Should have rails on all open sides |
| Are the planks secure? | No gaps, no bouncing |
| Is it level and stable? | On firm ground, not leaning |

**Access rule:** Use the built-in ladder or stairs—don't climb the cross-braces.

**If something seems wrong:** Don't use it. Tell your site lead.

## What to Do

### If You're Working at Height

1. **Know where the edges are** — look around before you start
2. **Work from the stable center** when possible
3. **Don't get too close to edges** unless there's protection
4. **Watch your footing** — debris, wet surfaces, cords
5. **Don't work distracted** — this isn't the place for conversations while walking

### If There's No Protection

If you're asked to work at 6+ feet without guardrails, personal fall arrest, or other protection:

1. **Ask about it.** "Is there a safer way to do this? Where's the fall protection?"
2. **If it doesn't exist**, don't do the work until it's addressed
3. **It's okay to say no.** No volunteer should be put in an unprotected fall situation.

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **6+ feet up, no guardrail** | Don't work there. Ask site lead. |
| **Near an edge** | Maintain awareness. Stay back. |
| **Floor hole** | Must be covered or guarded. Report if not. |
| **Skylight** | Treat as hole. Never walk on. |
| **Scaffold** | Check for guardrails, stability, inspection before climbing. |
| **Ladder** | See existing manual page 12 |

## Why This Matters

Falls kill more construction workers than anything else. The dangerous part? Most victims didn't think they were in danger. They were experienced. The height didn't seem that bad. They'd done it before.

Falls aren't about being careless. They're about getting comfortable with risk you shouldn't accept.
