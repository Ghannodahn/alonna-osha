## The Gap

The manual says: "If there is a fire or medical emergency, notify the instructor and site coordinator immediately."

That's not emergency response. That's panic protocol. It doesn't tell you:
- Who is the instructor? Where are they?
- What's the emergency number?
- Where do you go if you need to evacuate?
- What counts as "emergency" vs. "I can handle this"?

## When to Call 911

Call 911 immediately for:
- **Unconscious person**
- **Severe bleeding** (won't stop with pressure)
- **Difficulty breathing**
- **Chest pain**
- **Suspected broken bones** (especially spine, neck, skull)
- **Electrical shock**
- **Fall from height** (especially if they can't get up or seem confused)
- **Heat stroke** (hot, dry skin, confusion, unconsciousness)
- **Fire that's not immediately contained**

**Don't wait to "see if it gets better."** When in doubt, call.

## When to Get the Site Lead

For situations that need attention but aren't 911 emergencies:
- Cuts that need more than a bandage
- Sprains or strains
- Someone feeling dizzy or unwell
- Equipment damage or malfunction
- Near-misses (something almost happened)
- Any safety concern

---

## If You Hear the Evacuation Signal

1. **Stop what you're doing** — tools down, power off if safe
2. **Help anyone nearby** who needs assistance
3. **Go directly to the assembly point** — don't grab belongings
4. **Stay at the assembly point** until site lead gives all-clear
5. **Don't re-enter the site** until cleared

---

## If You Find Someone Injured

1. **Stay calm** — panic helps no one
2. **Assess the scene** — is it safe to approach?
3. **Don't move them** unless they're in immediate danger (fire, collapse)
4. **Call for help** — send someone to get the site lead or call 911
5. **Provide basic aid** if trained and it's safe to do so
6. **Stay with them** until help arrives

---

## First Aid Kit Basics

The kit should be identified at the start of each day. Know where it is before you need it.

**For minor cuts/scrapes:**
- Clean the wound
- Apply bandage
- Report to site lead

**For everything else:**
Get the site lead. Don't try to be a hero.

**Remember:** Always wear gloves when dealing with anyone else's blood.

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **911 emergency** | Call 911, then tell site lead |
| **Non-emergency injury** | Find site lead |
| **Near-miss** | Report to site lead (so we can prevent next time) |
| **Evacuation signal** | Stop, help others, go to assembly point |
| **Fire** | Alert others, evacuate, call 911 from safe distance |
| **Unsure if it's serious** | Err on the side of caution — get help |

---

## Why This Matters

Emergencies are rare. But when they happen, you don't have time to figure out the plan. Know it now so you can act when it counts.

**Before your first task today:** Ask the site lead who the safety contact is and where the first aid kit is located. That's not being overly cautious—it's being prepared.
