## The Gap

The manual mentions "Check all power cords for damage before use." That's it.

No guidance on:
- What happens when water and electricity mix
- Where extension cords are safe to use
- What to do if you find exposed wiring
- Why some outlets have those "Test/Reset" buttons

Electrocution is one of OSHA's Focus Four hazards—causing 8% of construction fatalities. Volunteers encounter extension cords, power tools, and temporary power on nearly every site.

## The Basics

### Water and Electricity Don't Mix

This sounds obvious. But think about it:
- Morning dew on grass where cords are running
- Puddles from overnight rain
- Drinks near power tools
- Sweaty hands

**Rule:** If it's wet, don't plug in or unplug. Keep cords off wet ground. Keep water away from anything electrical.

### GFCIs Save Lives

Those outlets with "Test" and "Reset" buttons? They're called GFCIs (Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters). They detect when electricity is going where it shouldn't—like through you—and cut the power in milliseconds.

**Rule:** Power tools on a construction site should be plugged into GFCI-protected outlets. If you don't see the test/reset buttons, ask your site lead.

### Extension Cords: The Limits

Extension cords are temporary solutions. They have limits:

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Daisy-chain cords (plug one into another) | Use one cord of appropriate length |
| Run under rugs, through doorways, or where they'll get pinched | Route cords along walls, out of walkways |
| Use indoor cords outside | Check the rating—outdoor cords are marked |
| Overload with multiple tools | One heavy tool per cord |
| Leave coiled while in use | Uncoil fully to prevent heat buildup |

## What to Do If...

### You Find Exposed Wiring

**Stop.** Don't touch it. Don't try to fix it.
1. Move away from the area
2. Tell others to stay clear
3. Find your site lead immediately
4. Don't assume "it's probably not live"

### A Cord Gets Damaged

Damaged cords are fire and shock hazards. If the outer jacket is cut, or you can see colored wires inside:
1. **Don't use it**
2. **Don't try to tape it** (tape is not a repair)
3. **Tell your site lead** so it can be replaced

### Someone Gets Shocked

If someone is being shocked (they can't let go):
1. **Don't touch them** — you'll get shocked too
2. **Kill the power** if you can reach the plug or breaker safely
3. **If you can't reach power safely**, use something non-conductive (dry wood, dry rope) to push or pull them away from the source
4. **Call 911**
5. **Start CPR** if they're not breathing and you're trained

## Overhead Powerlines

Those lines above the site carry serious voltage. Even getting close can be fatal—electricity can arc through air.

- **Stay at least 10 feet away** from power lines with tools, ladders, and materials
- **Look up** before raising ladders or carrying long materials
- **If equipment contacts a line**: stay in the equipment if possible, call for help. If you must exit, jump clear—don't step out.

---

## Quick Reference

- **Wet + electrical = stop**
- **GFCI outlets = required for power tools**
- **One tool per extension cord**
- **Damaged cord = don't use, report it**
- **Exposed wires = back away, tell site lead**
- **Powerlines = 10 feet minimum clearance**
- **Someone shocked = cut power, call 911**

---

## Why This Matters

Electricity moves fast. By the time you feel the shock, the damage is done. The rules exist because the consequences are severe and immediate—there's no "minor" electrical incident.
