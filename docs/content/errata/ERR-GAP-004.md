## The Gap

The manual says "Be aware of your surroundings at all times" but never explains what that means when people are working at different heights. There's no mention of:
- What happens when tools or materials fall from above
- How to communicate before dropping anything
- Where you shouldn't walk without a hard hat
- How to secure tools when you're elevated

Struck-by hazards cause approximately 10% of construction fatalities (2023 BLS data). Most could be prevented with simple coordination.

## What You Need to Know

### If Someone's Working Above You

**Wear your hard hat.** Not because of rules—because a dropped hammer from 10 feet hits hard. It's physics, not paperwork.

Before you walk under a ladder, scaffold, or anyone working overhead:
1. Make eye contact or call out "BELOW!"
2. Wait for acknowledgment
3. Move through quickly

If you hear "HEADS UP!" or "COMING DOWN!"—freeze, look up, then move clear.

### If You're Working Above Others

**Nothing leaves your hand by accident.** If it needs to go down, it goes on purpose with a warning.

- Tools stay in your belt or secured, not sitting on edges
- Scrap doesn't pile up—lower it regularly or designate a drop area
- Before dropping anything: "COMING DOWN!" and wait for clear

### Drop Zones

A drop zone is an area marked off because things might fall from above.
- Cones, tape, or just "don't go past here" verbal designation
- No shortcuts through drop zones—even quick ones
- If you have to enter, announce yourself and get acknowledgment

## The Calls

| Call | When |
|------|------|
| **"BELOW!"** | Entering an area where someone's working above |
| **"COMING DOWN!"** or **"HEADS UP!"** | Before dropping or lowering anything |
| **"COMING UP!"** | Climbing up to an elevated position |
| **"CLEAR!"** | Acknowledging it's safe to proceed |

## Hard Hat Zones

Wear your hard hat when working:
- Under scaffolding
- Under roof work
- Below active ladder work
- Anywhere overhead work is happening

No hard hat zone? Check with your site lead. When in doubt, put it on.

## Quick Reference

- **Above you? Hard hat on.**
- **You're above someone? Nothing drops without warning.**
- **Drop zones = stay out.**
- **Hear a warning? Freeze, look up, then move.**
- **Tools stay secured, not on edges.**
