## The Gap

The manual talks about safety as a priority but doesn't give you a way to actually think about safety before you start a task. There's no framework for:
- Spotting hazards before they become problems
- Assessing how serious something could be
- Deciding what to do about it

Most injuries happen because someone didn't see the hazard coming. Not because they were reckless—because they didn't pause to think.

## The 3-Question Check

Before starting any task, take 10 seconds and ask:

### 1. What could go wrong?

Look at what you're about to do. Where are the dangers?
- Tools that could slip
- Materials that could fall
- Surfaces you could trip on
- People who might walk into your work area
- Your own hands in relation to sharp edges

### 2. What would happen if it did?

How bad would it be?
- Minor annoyance? (splinter, small scrape)
- Trip to first aid? (cuts needing bandage)
- ER visit? (falls, serious cuts, eye injuries)
- Worse? (crushing, electrical, falls from height)

### 3. How do I prevent that?

What's the fix?
- **PPE** — glasses, gloves, hard hat for this task?
- **Technique** — right tool, secured workpiece?
- **Environment** — cleared area, stable footing?
- **Communication** — do others know what you're doing?

## A Been There Moment

I used to just dive in. See a task, grab the tool, get it done.

Then I nearly put a nail through my hand. The board was cracked—I didn't notice. If I'd looked at it for five seconds first, I would have seen it. But I was moving fast, focused on getting things done.

Now I take a breath before starting anything new. Not a big production—just a quick mental check: what could go wrong here? It's not paranoia. It's pattern recognition.

## Examples

### Cutting lumber with a hand saw

**What could go wrong?**
- Saw jumps, cuts hand
- Wood shifts, pinches saw or kicks up
- Sawdust in eyes

**How bad?**
- Hand cut: first aid to ER depending on severity
- Wood shifting: could cause fall or loss of balance
- Eyes: irritation to actual injury

**Prevention:**
- Safety glasses on
- Secure the wood (clamp it or have someone hold it)
- Cut away from body
- Steady, even strokes (rushing = mistakes)

### Carrying a ladder

**What could go wrong?**
- Hit someone with the end
- Trip on debris
- Pinch fingers setting it down

**How bad?**
- Hitting someone: bruises to serious injury
- Tripping: minor to moderate injury
- Pinching: painful, possibly serious

**Prevention:**
- Carry with end high enough to see past, or call "ladder coming through"
- Look at path before you move
- Watch hand placement when setting down

## When to Ask Instead

If you go through the 3-question check and find yourself unsure:
- "I don't know what could go wrong here"
- "This seems riskier than I know how to handle"
- "I've never done this before"

**Ask.** Find your site lead or supervisor. No question is too basic when it comes to safety.

## Not Overthinking — Just Thinking

This isn't about analyzing every possible hazard until you can't move. That's paralysis.

**Good 3-question check:**
- Quick scan (10-30 seconds)
- Notice obvious hazards
- Apply standard controls (PPE, technique, environment)
- Start with awareness

**Overthinking looks like:**
- Cataloging every possible thing that could happen
- Unable to start because "something might go wrong"
- Second-guessing tasks you've done safely many times

The cure: If you've got your PPE on, the work is secured, and you know where others are—you're ready. Start.

## Quick Reference

**Before any task:**

| Question | Takes |
|----------|-------|
| 1. What could go wrong? | 3 seconds |
| 2. How bad? | 2 seconds |
| 3. How do I prevent it? | 5 seconds |

**Total: 10 seconds. Every time.**

## For Supervisors

Make the 3-question check automatic by modeling it:

- **At morning briefing:** "Today we're doing [task]. Quick check: what could go wrong? How do we handle that?"
- **When someone starts a new task:** "Before you start—what do you see that could cause problems?"
- **Praise the pause:** Notice and acknowledge volunteers who stop to assess before starting.
