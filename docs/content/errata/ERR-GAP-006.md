## The Gap

The manual says one sentence: "When lifting heavy materials, always lift with your legs, not your back."

That's technically correct. But it doesn't tell you what to do when something actually feels too heavy. It doesn't mention:
- How to know when to ask for help
- Team lifts for heavy or awkward items
- Planning your path before you pick something up
- What to do when conditions change

Musculoskeletal disorders are a leading cause of construction injuries, with nearly half of workers reporting symptoms. Back injuries often don't heal completely.

## The Golden Rule

**If it feels too heavy, it is too heavy.**

That's it. Your body knows. Listen to it.

This rule overrides everything else—weight charts, proper technique, what anyone else is carrying. If it doesn't feel right, it isn't right.

## A Been There Moment

First time on a build site, I watched everyone else carrying lumber, handling materials, getting it done. Nobody was struggling. So I grabbed a bundle of shingles and tried to carry it like everyone else.

My back let me know that was a mistake. Not immediately—the next morning. Couldn't bend over for a week.

Here's what nobody told me: asking for help isn't weakness. It's knowing your limits. And your limits are different from everyone else's limits.

Now my rule is simple: if it feels too heavy, it is. No ego about it. No "I've got this." Just a quick "hey, can you grab the other end?"

## What Makes Something "Too Heavy"

Weight is only part of it. Something that weighs 40 pounds might feel fine in the morning and too heavy at 4pm. It depends on:

| Factor | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Your condition** | Tired, dehydrated, or already sore = lower capacity |
| **The shape** | Awkward shapes are heavier than they weigh |
| **The path** | Stairs, uneven ground, obstacles = harder |
| **The grip** | Wet, slippery, no good handholds = treat it as heavier |
| **Your history** | Prior back injury? Your limits are different now |

## Before You Lift

Every time. Even if it looks easy.

1. **Test the weight** — Tip one end up. Does it feel manageable? If not, get help.
2. **Plan the path** — Where are you going? What's in the way? Clear it first.
3. **Position yourself** — Close to the load, feet shoulder-width apart.
4. **Lift with your legs** — Bend knees, keep back straight, push up with your legs.
5. **Keep it close** — The farther from your body, the heavier it becomes.
6. **Don't twist** — Turn with your feet, not your back.

## When to Get Help

- **It feels too heavy** (Golden Rule)
- **It's awkward** — sheet goods, long lumber, anything you can't grip securely
- **The path is tricky** — stairs, tight corners, slippery surfaces
- **You've already been lifting** — fatigue sneaks up on you
- **Two people are available** — why not make it easier?

**Say this:** "Hey, can you grab the other end?" Nobody thinks less of you for asking. They think less of people who hurt themselves trying to prove something.

---

## Quick Reference

- **Golden Rule:** If it feels too heavy, it is.
- **Test before you lift** — tip one end, assess.
- **Lift with legs** — bend knees, straight back.
- **Keep load close** — arms-length max.
- **Don't twist** — pivot with feet.
- **Ask for help** — zero shame, smart move.

## Common Responses to "I've Got It"

| What You Might Think | What's Actually True |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| "I can handle it" | Maybe. But if there's any doubt, you're gambling with your back. |
| "I don't want to slow things down" | An injury slows things down way more. We've got time. |
| "Everyone else is doing it" | Everyone else has different bodies and experience. Your limits are yours. |
| "It's just one more" | The ER is full of "just one more" stories. |
