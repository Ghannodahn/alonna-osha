## Side-by-Side Comparison: Ladder Safety

### Original (Building Beyond the Walls)
> "Always maintain a 3-point (two hands and a foot or two feet and a hand) contact on the ladder while climbing. Keep your body within the side rails. Never over reach."

### Straight Talk
> "Keep three points on the ladder - two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand. Always. Stay centered. If your belt buckle goes past the rails, you're overreaching. Come down and move the ladder."

### Been There
> "The reason they say '3-point contact' is because that's your stability. Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand - always. The moment you've only got two points, you're one shift away from trouble."

### Let's Figure This Out
> "Why do people fall off ladders? They're moving too fast with too few handholds. Solution: Three points of contact, always. Two hands one foot, or two feet one hand. If your belt buckle goes past the side rails, stop. Come down. Move the ladder."

### Real Consequences
> "Keep 3 points on the ladder. Always. Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand. The second you're down to two points, you're one lean away from losing balance."

### Quick Hits
> "3 points on the ladder. Two hands + foot, or two feet + hand. Belt buckle between the rails. Past the rails = overreaching = move the ladder."

Each tone was designed to be understandable at approximately 8th-grade reading level or below:
- ✓ Short sentences
- ✓ Common words
- ✓ No unexplained jargon

### Actionability
Each message ends with clear "do this" guidance. No message is purely informational.

### Peer-to-Peer Voice Check

- ✓ No compliance language ("you must", "failure to...")
- ✓ No authority positioning
- ✓ Conversational rhythm

## Implementation Recommendation

### Phase 1: Pilot
Test with one or two volunteer groups:
- Use **Been There** for orientation
- Provide **Quick Hits** cards
- Gather feedback on tone, clarity, usefulness

### Phase 2: Refine
Based on feedback:
- Adjust language that doesn't land
- Identify which tones resonate with this specific population
- Create supervisor training on tone selection

### Phase 3: Full Deployment
- Orientation packet with all **Been There** messages
- **Quick Hits** cards for point-of-use
- Supervisor guide with all tones and usage recommendations
- **Let's Figure This Out** discussion guides for deeper sessions

## Comparison to Original Content

| Metric | Original | Peer-to-Peer |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Tone | Authoritative | Peer helper |
| Voice | Passive | Active |
| "Why" included | Rarely | Always |
| Memorable | Dense lists | Stories, threes, bullets |
| Actionable | Somewhat | Explicitly |
| Testable | Difficult | Clear checkpoints |

---

## Success Criteria Alignment

| Project Goal | How Tones Address It |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Accessible to varied backgrounds | Multiple tones for different learning styles |
| Impactful and memorable | Stories, consequences, brevity as tools |
| "Why" not just rules | Every tone explains rationale |
| Peer-to-peer, not authoritative | Core design principle, verified |
| Works across literacy levels | Simple language, short sentences, visual aids |
| Volunteers feel confident | "Been There" validates learning curve |

---

## Final Selection

### Primary Choice: Been There (Tone 2)

**Selected as the default tone for all core content.**

**Rationale:**
- Builds trust and connection with volunteers from first contact
- Story-based format creates natural memorability without requiring repetition
- Validates the learning curve, reducing anxiety for first-time volunteers
- "I've been there" framing eliminates authority positioning while maintaining credibility
- Works across diverse backgrounds and literacy levels through conversational rhythm
- Aligns directly with the project's peer-to-peer philosophy

**Usage:** Orientation materials, primary training content, section introductions, and any content where building volunteer confidence matters.

---

### Runner-Up: Straight Talk (Tone 1)

**Reserved for refresher content and experienced volunteer communications.**

**Rationale:**
- Respects the time of returning volunteers who already understand the "why"
- Efficient for quick reviews before tasks
- Clear action items without redundant context
- Pairs well with Been There—use Been There for initial training, Straight Talk for refreshers

**Usage:** Refresher sessions, experienced volunteer briefings, and supplementary quick-reference materials.

---

### Infographic-Only: Quick Hits (Tone 5)

**Exclusively for visual materials and point-of-use signage.**

**Rationale:**
- Maximum brevity suits signage and visual formats
- Easy scanning during active work
- Complements deeper Been There training rather than replacing it
- Not suitable for standalone learning—relies on prior understanding

**Usage:** Safety signs, laminated cards, infographic callouts, and morning briefing bullet points.

---

### Not Selected for Primary Use: Tones 3-4

**Let's Figure This Out (Tone 3)** and **Real Consequences (Tone 4)** were evaluated but not selected for primary content.

**Let's Figure This Out:**
- Valuable for resistant audiences or deep-dive discussions
- Requires more cognitive engagement than typical orientation settings
- Better suited for facilitated small-group sessions, not written materials
- *May be used situationally* for complex topics requiring buy-in

**Real Consequences:**
- Risk of overuse creating fear-based messaging
- May increase anxiety in already-nervous first-time volunteers
- Appropriate gravitas becomes problematic when applied broadly
- *Reserved for* post-incident communications or genuinely high-stakes topics only

**Bottom line:** These tones are tools in the toolkit, not primary voices. Use sparingly and with clear purpose.
