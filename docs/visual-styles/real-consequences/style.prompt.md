# Real Consequences Visual Style - Image Generation Prompt

## Style: "The Incident Report"

Create a safety infographic with these exact visual specifications:

### Visual Tone
Documentary, evidence-based, serious but not fear-mongering. Like a safety review or lessons-learned report. Facts carry weight. Statistics and consequences presented honestly. Protective, not punitive.

### Color Palette (EXACT HEX CODES)
- Primary text: Near Black #1A202C
- Background: Clinical White #FFFFFF
- Warning level: ANSI Orange #DD6B20 (use strategically)
- Danger level: ANSI Red #C53030 (use sparingly, earns attention)
- Evidence/data: Steel Blue #4A5568
- Prevention/success: Safe Green #276749

### Typography Style
- Headers: Heavy sans-serif with gravitas (like Roboto Bold or Source Sans Bold)
- Body: Clean sans-serif, professional
- Statistics: Large, condensed, tabular numerals
- Case study text: Slightly different treatment (indented or boxed)

### Layout Requirements
- Documentary structure: evidence before argument
- Large statistic blocks with visual weight (big numbers, evidence bars)
- Cause → Consequence chains clearly mapped
- Prevention section with green accent (positive framing)
- Clinical but human - facts with purpose

### Graphic Elements
- Large numerals for statistics (#1, 43%, etc.)
- Evidence bars (simple horizontal fills showing data)
- Realistic silhouettes (not cartoonish)
- Before/after or situation → outcome flows
- Double-line borders for case study boxes
- Checkmark (✓) for prevention sections

### Color Application
- RESTRAINT is key - not everything is red
- Red/orange EARNS attention through strategic use
- Most content in neutral (black, gray, blue)
- Green for prevention/solution sections
- Color hierarchy: neutral base, strategic warnings, green resolution

### DON'T Include
- Graphic or disturbing imagery
- Fear-mongering visuals
- Overwhelming use of warning colors
- Casual or playful elements
- Decoration without information

### MUST Include
- A prominent statistic (large number with context)
- Cause → consequence relationship clearly shown
- Prevention callout with green accent
- Documentary, evidence-based presentation
- Honest gravity without manipulation
