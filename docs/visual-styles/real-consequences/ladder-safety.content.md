# LADDER FALLS: THE DATA

## Key Statistic
A leading cause of construction injuries

Most falls occur at surprisingly low heights. That's not dramatic. It's enough.

## What Goes Wrong (Cause → Consequence)

| Cause | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| Ladder kicks out at base | Broken wrist, back injury |
| Overreaching for "one more inch" | Loss of balance, awkward fall |
| Moving too fast, too few holds | Uncontrolled landing |
| Standing on top step | Nothing to grab, fall backward |

None of these are freak accidents. They're predictable.

## How to Not Be a Statistic

### ✓ Prevention Steps

1. Have someone hold the base. Every time.
2. Keep 3 points on the ladder. Always.
3. Belt buckle past the rails? Stop. Move the ladder.
4. Top step is a handhold, not a step.

## Reality Check
You came here to help build something. Going home injured doesn't help anyone.

The difference between a close call and an injury is often 30 seconds of doing it right.
