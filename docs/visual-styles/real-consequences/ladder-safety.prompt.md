# Real Consequences Visual Style - Ladder Safety Infographic

Create a safety infographic with these exact visual specifications:

## Style: "The Incident Report"

### Visual Tone
Documentary, evidence-based, serious but not fear-mongering. Like a safety review or lessons-learned report. Facts carry weight. Statistics and consequences presented honestly. Protective, not punitive.

### Color Palette (EXACT HEX CODES)
- Primary text: Near Black #1A202C
- Background: Clinical White #FFFFFF
- Warning level: ANSI Orange #DD6B20 (use strategically)
- Danger level: ANSI Red #C53030 (use sparingly, earns attention)
- Evidence/data: Steel Blue #4A5568
- Prevention/success: Safe Green #276749

### Typography Style
- Headers: Heavy sans-serif with gravitas (like Roboto Bold or Source Sans Bold)
- Body: Clean sans-serif, professional
- Statistics: Large, condensed, tabular numerals
- Case study text: Slightly different treatment (indented or boxed)

### Layout Requirements
- Documentary structure: evidence before argument
- Large statistic blocks with visual weight (big numbers, evidence bars)
- Cause → Consequence chains clearly mapped
- Prevention section with green accent (positive framing)
- Clinical but human - facts with purpose

### Graphic Elements
- Large numerals for statistics (#1, 43%, etc.)
- Evidence bars (simple horizontal fills showing data)
- Realistic silhouettes (not cartoonish)
- Before/after or situation → outcome flows
- Double-line borders for case study boxes
- Checkmark for prevention sections

### Color Application
- RESTRAINT is key - not everything is red
- Red/orange EARNS attention through strategic use
- Most content in neutral (black, gray, blue)
- Green for prevention/solution sections

## CONTENT TO VISUALIZE

# LADDER FALLS: THE DATA

## Key Statistic
A leading cause of construction injuries

Most falls occur at surprisingly low heights. That's not dramatic. It's enough.

## What Goes Wrong (Cause → Consequence)

| Cause | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| Ladder kicks out at base | Broken wrist, back injury |
| Overreaching for "one more inch" | Loss of balance, awkward fall |
| Moving too fast, too few holds | Uncontrolled landing |
| Standing on top step | Nothing to grab, fall backward |

None of these are freak accidents. They're predictable.

## How to Not Be a Statistic

### Prevention Steps
1. Have someone hold the base. Every time.
2. Keep 3 points on the ladder. Always.
3. Belt buckle past the rails? Stop. Move the ladder.
4. Top step is a handhold, not a step.

## Reality Check
You came here to help build something. Going home injured doesn't help anyone.

The difference between a close call and an injury is often 30 seconds of doing it right.
