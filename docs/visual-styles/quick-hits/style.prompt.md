## Style: "The Pocket Card"

Create a safety infographic with these exact visual specifications:

### Visual Tone
Ultra-efficient, point-of-use reference, maximum compression. Like a laminated pocket card that survives a day on the jobsite. Scannable in seconds. Respects that the reader has work to do.

### Color Palette (EXACT HEX CODES)
- Primary text: Pure Black #000000 (maximum contrast)
- Background: Pure White #FFFFFF
- Accent: Safety Yellow #FFD100 (header bar only)
- Border: Black #000000 (heavy weight)
- Secondary (rare): Medium Gray #666666

### Typography Style
- Headers: Condensed bold (like Oswald or Barlow Condensed)
- Body: Condensed sans-serif, efficient
- MINIMAL text - every word earns its space
- Tight leading, compact line spacing
- Tabular numerals for any numbers

### Layout Requirements
- Card frame with heavy black border
- Header bar with topic name + time indicator (e.g., "30 sec")
- Checkbox list format (□ for items)
- Table format for quick reference data
- "Unsure? → ASK" escape valve at bottom
- MAXIMUM DENSITY - but still readable

### Graphic Elements
- Simple checkboxes (□) - empty, usable
- Minimal pictogram-style icons (ISO safety sign quality)
- Heavy borders defining card edge
- Horizontal dividers separating sections
- Arrows (→) for quick references
- Time indicators (30 sec, 1 min)

### Format Considerations
- Works at pocket card size (3x5 or 4x6 inches)
- Readable at arm's length
- Scannable in under 10 seconds
- Survives lamination
- Works in SINGLE COLOR printing (must be effective in B&W)

### DON'T Include
- Decorative elements of any kind
- Large images or illustrations
- Lengthy explanations
- Soft colors or gradients
- Rounded corners or soft edges
- Anything that wastes space

### MUST Include
- Heavy card-frame border
- Topic + time commitment in header
- Checkbox list format
- "Unsure? → ASK" footer
- Extreme compression - pocket-card density
- Would work printed on a hardhat sticker
