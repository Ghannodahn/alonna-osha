## Style: "The Field Notebook"

Create a safety infographic with these exact visual specifications:

### Visual Tone
Warm, personal, experiential. Like wisdom passed down from a veteran. Think well-used field notebook with margin notes, trusted mentor's journal, worn but reliable.

### Color Palette (EXACT HEX CODES)
- Primary text: Dark Brown #3D2B1F
- Background: Cream/Aged Paper #F5F0E8
- Accent: Workworn Orange #CC7722 (warm, not bright)
- Secondary: Sage Green #8B9A6B (for tips and positive notes)
- Highlight: Faded Yellow #F7E7A2 (for emphasized passages)

### Typography Style
- Headers: Rounded, friendly sans-serif (like Nunito or Varela Round)
- Body: Readable serif (like Georgia or Merriweather)
- Mixed case, conversational capitalization
- Slightly informal, approachable

### Layout Requirements
- Organic flow, not rigidly gridded
- Story/anecdote callout boxes with dashed or notebook-style borders
- Arrow bullets (→) suggesting journey and direction
- "Wisdom box" sections with rounded corners
- Comfortable margins, breathing room

### Graphic Elements
- Hand-drawn or sketch-like illustration style
- Imperfect lines (slight wobble, human touch)
- Notebook paper hints (subtle lines or margins)
- Personal notation markers (📝, 💡)
- Warm, earthy color application

### Texture (Subtle)
- Very light paper grain texture (5-10% opacity)
- Aged/worn paper feel
- Could suggest coffee-stained or dog-eared corners
- NOT distracting - texture enhances, doesn't dominate

- Sharp, industrial edges
- Bright, saturated colors
- Technical/blueprint aesthetic
- Perfect geometric shapes
- Cold, clinical feel

### MUST Include
- Story callout section (dashed border, inset, different background)
