# Ladders - What I Learned the Hard Way

## Story from the Field
"First time I used a ladder on site, I was carrying trim with one hand, holding a rung with the other, moving fast. I didn't fall, but I came close enough that my heart was pounding."

## What That Day Taught Me

### → Always have someone hold the base
It feels silly to ask. Ask anyway. The experienced folks always do.

### → Keep three points on the ladder
Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand. That's your stability. I lost that when I was carrying stuff.

### → Don't stretch for "just one more inch"
If your belt buckle goes past the rails, you're already in trouble. Come down. Move it. I know it feels like extra work, but so does physical therapy.

### → The top step isn't actually a step
It's there so you have something to grab. Stand on it and you've got nothing when you wobble.

## Key Insight
Nobody's impressed by how fast you can climb. They're impressed by people who don't get hurt.
