# Been There Visual Style - Ladder Safety Infographic

Create a safety infographic with these exact visual specifications:

## Style: "The Field Notebook"

### Visual Tone
Warm, personal, experiential. Like wisdom passed down from a veteran. Think well-used field notebook with margin notes, trusted mentor's journal, worn but reliable.

### Color Palette (EXACT HEX CODES)
- Primary text: Dark Brown #3D2B1F
- Background: Cream/Aged Paper #F5F0E8
- Accent: Workworn Orange #CC7722 (warm, not bright)
- Secondary: Sage Green #8B9A6B (for tips and positive notes)
- Highlight: Faded Yellow #F7E7A2 (for emphasized passages)

### Typography Style
- Headers: Rounded, friendly sans-serif (like Nunito or Varela Round)
- Body: Readable serif (like Georgia or Merriweather)
- Mixed case, conversational capitalization
- Slightly informal, approachable

### Layout Requirements
- Organic flow, not rigidly gridded
- Story/anecdote callout boxes with dashed or notebook-style borders
- Arrow bullets (→) suggesting journey and direction
- "Wisdom box" sections with rounded corners
- Comfortable margins, breathing room

### Graphic Elements
- Hand-drawn or sketch-like illustration style
- Imperfect lines (slight wobble, human touch)
- Notebook paper hints (subtle lines or margins)
- Personal notation markers (pencil icon, lightbulb icon)
- Warm, earthy color application

### Texture (Subtle)
- Very light paper grain texture (5-10% opacity)
- Aged/worn paper feel
- Could suggest coffee-stained or dog-eared corners
- NOT distracting - texture enhances, doesn't dominate

# Ladders - What I Learned the Hard Way

## Story from the Field
"First time I used a ladder on site, I was carrying trim with one hand, holding a rung with the other, moving fast. I didn't fall, but I came close enough that my heart was pounding."

## What That Day Taught Me

### → Always have someone hold the base
It feels silly to ask. Ask anyway. The experienced folks always do.

### → Keep three points on the ladder
Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand. That's your stability.

### → Don't stretch for "just one more inch"
If your belt buckle goes past the rails, you're already in trouble. Come down. Move it.

### → The top step isn't actually a step
It's there so you have something to grab. Stand on it and you've got nothing when you wobble.

## Key Insight
Nobody's impressed by how fast you can climb. They're impressed by people who don't get hurt.
