# Let's Figure This Out Visual Style - Ladder Safety Infographic

Create a safety infographic with these exact visual specifications:

## Style: "The Whiteboard Session"

### Visual Tone
Collaborative, exploratory, educational. Like a productive training session on a whiteboard. Think marker diagrams, flowcharts, thinking out loud together. Inquiry-driven learning.

### Color Palette (EXACT HEX CODES - Whiteboard Marker Colors)
- Primary text/diagrams: Marker Blue #2C5282
- Background: Whiteboard White #FFFFFF (clean, bright)
- Questions/inquiry: Marker Green #38A169
- Answers/conclusions: Marker Blue #3182CE
- Warnings/alerts: Marker Red #E53E3E
- Supporting text: Marker Black #2D3748

### Typography Style
- Headers: Marker-style font (like Permanent Marker or Caveat Bold)
- Body: Clean, friendly sans-serif (like Open Sans or Lato)
- Questions marked with "?" prominently
- Answers/resolutions marked with checkmark

### Layout Requirements
- Diagram-centric - flowcharts, process flows, connected thinking
- Question at top driving the content
- Cause → Effect → Solution mapping
- Hand-drawn boxes, circles, arrows connecting concepts
- Before/after or comparison layouts welcome

### Graphic Elements
- Flowchart elements: boxes, arrows, diamonds (decision points)
- Hand-drawn quality to shapes (not perfectly geometric)
- Marker texture on lines and fills
- Connection lines showing relationships
- "?" and checkmark as visual cues throughout

### Whiteboard Effects
- Clean white background
- Marker imperfections (slight texture, occasional overlap)
- NOT cluttered - whiteboard has space
- Diagrams feel sketched during a meeting

# Why Do People Fall Off Ladders?

## Let's Think Through This
Most ladder falls happen at surprisingly low heights. That's not dramatic. So what's going wrong?

## Cause → Effect → Fix Diagram

### CAUSE 1: Base kicks out
→ EFFECT: Whole ladder slides, you go down with it
→ FIX: Someone holds the base

### CAUSE 2: Overreaching
→ EFFECT: Weight shifts outside the ladder, you lose balance
→ FIX: Belt buckle stays between the rails

### CAUSE 3: Moving too fast, too few holds
→ EFFECT: Lose grip, awkward landing
→ FIX: 3 points on the ladder always

### CAUSE 4: Standing on top step
→ EFFECT: Nothing to grab when you wobble
→ FIX: Top step = handhold, not a step

## Makes Sense?
The fixes map directly to the causes. Ladder safety is mostly just not rushing.

## Takeaway
✓ Every fall has a predictable cause. Prevent the cause, prevent the fall.
