# Why Do People Fall?

## Let's Think
Most falls: under 10 feet. What's wrong?

## Cause → Effect → Fix

Base kicks out → Fall → Spotter

Overreaching → Lose balance → Stay centered

Moving fast → Lose grip → 3 points

Top step used → Nothing to grab → Handhold only

## Takeaway
✓ Prevent cause. Prevent fall.
