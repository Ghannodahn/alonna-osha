# Why Do People Fall Off Ladders?

## Let's Think Through This

Most ladder falls happen at surprisingly low heights. That's not dramatic. So what's going wrong?

## Cause → Effect Diagram

### CAUSE 1: Base kicks out
→ EFFECT: Whole ladder slides, you go down with it
→ FIX: Someone holds the base

### CAUSE 2: Overreaching
→ EFFECT: Weight shifts outside the ladder, you lose balance
→ FIX: Belt buckle stays between the rails. Past the rails? Move the ladder.

### CAUSE 3: Moving too fast, too few holds
→ EFFECT: Lose grip, awkward landing
→ FIX: 3 points on the ladder. Always. (2 hands + foot, or 2 feet + hand)

### CAUSE 4: Standing on top step
→ EFFECT: Nothing to grab when you wobble
→ FIX: Top step = handhold, not a step

## Makes Sense?

The fixes map directly to the causes. Ladder safety is mostly just not rushing.

## Takeaway
✓ Every fall has a predictable cause. Prevent the cause, prevent the fall.
