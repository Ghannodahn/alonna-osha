# LADDER SAFETY

## Key Fact
Falls from ladders: a leading cause of construction injuries. Not from roofs - from regular ladders, often at surprisingly low heights.

## Critical Actions

### 1. HAVE SOMEONE HOLD THE BASE
Every time. No exceptions.

### 2. KEEP 3 POINTS ON THE LADDER
Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand. Always.

### 3. STAY CENTERED
Belt buckle past the rails? You're overreaching. Come down and move the ladder.

### 4. TOP STEP = HANDHOLD
It's not a step. Stand on it and you've got nothing to grab when you wobble.

## Bottom Line
Takes 30 extra seconds to do it right. That's cheaper than an ambulance ride.
