# OSHA Safety Message Refinement Project

## Goal

Refine safety messaging to effectively communicate OSHA standards to volunteer construction workers with diverse backgrounds and learning styles.

## Target Audience

- **Who**: People "off the street" volunteering for basic construction work
- **Context**: OSHA standards are important but poorly understood by this audience
- **Challenge**: Wide variety of backgrounds, education levels, and learning styles

## Success Criteria

- Message is accessible to people with no prior construction/safety knowledge
- Multiple tonal approaches to reach different learning styles
- Content is impactful and memorable
- Volunteers understand WHY safety matters, not just rules to follow

## Approach

Develop multiple message variations with different tones:
- Direct/authoritative (for rule-followers)
- Friendly/conversational (for social learners)
- Story-based/narrative (for emotional engagement)
- Visual/practical (for hands-on learners)

## Key Considerations

1. **Literacy levels vary** - avoid jargon, use simple language
2. **Cultural backgrounds differ** - be inclusive in examples and imagery
3. **Motivation matters** - connect safety to personal well-being, not just compliance
4. **Retention is key** - memorable messages stick better than dry regulations
