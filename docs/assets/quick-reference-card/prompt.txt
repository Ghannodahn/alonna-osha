Two-sided pocket reference card for construction safety facilitators. Flat graphic design, print-ready.

FRONT SIDE:
Title: "When Someone's Struggling"
Subtitle: "What to say (and what to skip)"

Five rows of phrase comparisons:
- X "Don't fall" → Check "Three points on the ladder"
- X "Calm down" → Check "I'm right here"
- X "It's not a big deal" → Check "That's a reasonable concern"
- X "Just do it" → Check "One step at a time"
- X "Be careful" → Check "Watch the nail by your foot"

Below that, the RACE framework box:
Title: "RACE — 10 seconds when someone freezes"
- R = Recognize their state (white knuckles, not moving)
- A = Acknowledge briefly ("Ladders feel wobbly at first.")
- C = Concrete action — one specific move ("Right hand to the next rung.")
- E = Empower ("Good. You've got it.")

BACK SIDE:
Title: "15-Minute Session Flow"

Vertical timeline with 7 stops:
- 0-1 min: OPENING — "I've done this a while..." Today: 4 points, 15 minutes
- 1-3 min: LIFTING & CARRYING — Get close, test weight, ask for help
- 3-5 min: WORKING AT HEIGHTS — 4:1 ratio, 3-point contact, spotter
- 5-7 min: AWARENESS — "Heads up!", Know your neighbors
- 7-9 min: TOOLS — PPE on, Guards stay on, "Feels wrong? Stop and ask"
- 9-12 min: DEMO — You do it, They try, Group confirms
- 12-15 min: CLOSE — "If unsure, ask." Point to site lead.
