## Part 1: Before You Work

### 1.3 Pre-Task Hazard Assessment (Page 9)

**Erratum ID:** ERR-GAP-008 | **Priority:** P1

#### The 3-Question Check — Think Before You Start

Most injuries happen because someone didn't see the hazard coming. Not because they were reckless—because they didn't pause to think.

Before starting any task, take 10 seconds:

**1. What could go wrong?**
- Tools that could slip
- Materials that could fall
- Surfaces you could trip on
- People who might walk into your work area

**2. What would happen if it did?**
- Minor annoyance? (splinter, small scrape)
- Trip to first aid? (cuts needing bandage)
- ER visit? (falls, serious cuts)
- Worse? (crushing, electrical, falls from height)

**3. How do I prevent that?**
- PPE — glasses, gloves, hard hat for this task?
- Technique — right tool, secured workpiece?
- Environment — cleared area, stable footing?
- Communication — do others know what you're doing?

**Quick Reference:**
| Question | Takes |
|----------|-------|
| What could go wrong? | 3 seconds |
| How bad? | 2 seconds |
| How do I prevent it? | 5 seconds |
| **Total** | **10 seconds** |

### 1.4 Emergency Response (Page 13)

**Erratum ID:** ERR-GAP-003 | **Priority:** P0

#### Emergency Response — Know Before You Need It

The manual says: "If there is a fire or medical emergency, notify the instructor and site coordinator immediately." That's not actionable during a crisis.

**Site Information (fill in at start of each work day):**

| Role | Name | Location |
|------|------|----------|
| **Site Lead** | __________________ | __________________ |
| **Safety Contact** | __________________ | __________________ |
| **First Aid Kit** | N/A | __________________ |

**Emergency Number:** 911

**Assembly Point:** ______________________________

**Evacuation Signal:** ______________________________

#### When to Call 911

Call immediately for:
- Unconscious person
- Severe bleeding (won't stop with pressure)
- Difficulty breathing or chest pain
- Suspected broken bones (especially spine, neck, skull)
- Electrical shock
- Fall from height (especially if confused or can't get up)
- Heat stroke (hot dry skin, confusion, unconsciousness)
- Fire that's not immediately contained

**Don't wait to "see if it gets better."** When in doubt, call.

#### If You Hear the Evacuation Signal

1. Stop what you're doing — tools down, power off if safe
2. Help anyone nearby who needs assistance
3. Go directly to the assembly point — don't grab belongings
4. Stay at the assembly point until site lead gives all-clear
5. Don't re-enter the site until cleared

#### If You Find Someone Injured

1. Stay calm — panic helps no one
2. Assess the scene — is it safe to approach?
3. Don't move them unless in immediate danger
4. Call for help — send someone to get site lead or call 911
5. Provide basic aid if trained and safe to do so
6. Stay with them until help arrives

**OSHA Reference:** General Duty Clause

## Part 2: Working Safely

### 2.1 Fall Protection (Page 12)

**Erratum ID:** ERR-GAP-002 | **Priority:** P0

#### Fall Protection — The 6-Foot Rule and Beyond

Falls are the #1 cause of construction fatalities — 39% of deaths. The manual covers ladder safety but stops there.

#### The 6-Foot Rule

If you're working 6 feet or more above the level below, fall protection is required.

That's not as high as it sounds:
- Second-story work
- Flat roof access
- Some scaffold platforms
- Elevated walkways

**Rule:** If you're at 6 feet or more and there's no guardrail or other protection—don't be there. Ask your site lead how to do the work safely.

#### Hazards Beyond Ladders

**Edges:**
- Roof edges (flat or sloped)
- Scaffold edges without guardrails
- Open floors in multi-story construction
- Loading docks

What to look for: 39 inches of solid barrier (standard guardrail height) or stay back.

**Floor Holes:**
- Stairwell openings before stairs installed
- Holes cut for HVAC or plumbing
- Removed panels

Rule: If there's a hole, it should be covered and marked, or guarded. Report if not.

**Skylights:**
Skylights look solid but often can't support your weight. Treat them like holes.

#### Scaffolds (If Used)

| Before You Climb | Ask |
|------------------|-----|
| Has it been inspected? | Someone qualified should check it each day |
| Are the guardrails in place? | Should have rails on all open sides |
| Are the planks secure? | No gaps, no bouncing |
| Is it level and stable? | On firm ground, not leaning |

Access rule: Use the built-in ladder or stairs—don't climb the cross-braces.

#### Quick Reference

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| 6+ feet up, no guardrail | Don't work there. Ask site lead. |
| Near an edge | Maintain awareness. Stay back. |
| Floor hole | Must be covered or guarded. Report if not. |
| Skylight | Treat as hole. Never walk on. |
| Scaffold | Check guardrails, stability before climbing. |

**OSHA Reference:** 29 CFR 1926.501-503

### 2.2 Working Above and Below Others (Page 10)

**Erratum ID:** ERR-GAP-004 | **Priority:** P0

#### Working Above and Below Others

Struck-by hazards cause approximately 10% of construction fatalities. Most could be prevented with simple coordination.

#### If Someone's Working Above You

**Wear your hard hat.** A dropped hammer from 10 feet hits hard.

Before walking under a ladder, scaffold, or anyone working overhead:
1. Make eye contact or call out "BELOW!"
2. Wait for acknowledgment
3. Move through quickly

If you hear "HEADS UP!" or "COMING DOWN!"—freeze, look up, then move clear.

#### If You're Working Above Others

**Nothing leaves your hand by accident.** If it needs to go down, it goes on purpose with a warning.

- Tools stay in your belt or secured, not sitting on edges
- Scrap doesn't pile up—lower it regularly or designate a drop area
- Before dropping anything: "COMING DOWN!" and wait for clear

#### The Calls

| Call | When |
|------|------|
| "BELOW!" | Entering an area where someone's working above |
| "COMING DOWN!" or "HEADS UP!" | Before dropping or lowering anything |
| "COMING UP!" | Climbing up to an elevated position |
| "CLEAR!" | Acknowledging it's safe to proceed |

#### Hard Hat Zones

Wear your hard hat when working:
- Under scaffolding
- Under roof work
- Below active ladder work
- Anywhere overhead work is happening

#### Quick Reference

- Above you? Hard hat on.
- You're above someone? Nothing drops without warning.
- Drop zones = stay out.
- Hear a warning? Freeze, look up, then move.
- Tools stay secured, not on edges.

**OSHA Reference:** 29 CFR 1926.451(h), 1926.502(j)

### 2.3 Manual Handling (Page 10)

**Erratum ID:** ERR-GAP-006 | **Priority:** P1

#### The Golden Rule of Manual Handling

The manual says: "When lifting heavy materials, always lift with your legs, not your back."

That's correct but incomplete. It doesn't tell you what to do when something actually feels too heavy.

#### The Golden Rule

**If it feels too heavy, it is too heavy.**

Your body knows. Listen to it. This rule overrides everything else—weight charts, proper technique, what anyone else is carrying.

#### What Makes Something "Too Heavy"

Weight is only part of it. It depends on:

| Factor | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Your condition | Tired, dehydrated, or already sore = lower capacity |
| The shape | Awkward shapes are heavier than they weigh |
| The path | Stairs, uneven ground, obstacles = harder |
| The grip | Wet, slippery, no good handholds = treat it as heavier |
| Your history | Prior back injury? Your limits are different now |

#### Before You Lift

Every time:

1. **Test the weight** — Tip one end up. Does it feel manageable?
2. **Plan the path** — Where are you going? What's in the way?
3. **Position yourself** — Close to the load, feet shoulder-width apart
4. **Lift with your legs** — Bend knees, keep back straight, push up with legs
5. **Keep it close** — The farther from your body, the heavier it becomes
6. **Don't twist** — Turn with your feet, not your back

#### When to Get Help

- It feels too heavy (Golden Rule)
- It's awkward — sheet goods, long lumber, anything you can't grip securely
- The path is tricky — stairs, tight corners, slippery surfaces
- You've already been lifting — fatigue sneaks up on you
- Two people are available — why not make it easier?

**Say this:** "Hey, can you grab the other end?"

#### Quick Reference

- Golden Rule: If it feels too heavy, it is.
- Test before you lift — tip one end, assess.
- Lift with legs — bend knees, straight back.
- Keep load close — arms-length max.
- Don't twist — pivot with feet.
- Ask for help — zero shame, smart move.

### 2.5 Electrical Safety (Page 11)

**Erratum ID:** ERR-GAP-001 | **Priority:** P0

#### Electrical Safety Essentials

The manual mentions: "Check all power cords for damage before use." That's it.

Electrocution is one of OSHA's Focus Four hazards—causing 8% of construction fatalities. Volunteers encounter extension cords, power tools, and temporary power on nearly every site.

#### The Basics

**Water and Electricity Don't Mix**

Think about: morning dew, puddles, drinks near tools, sweaty hands.

**Rule:** If it's wet, don't plug in or unplug. Keep cords off wet ground.

**GFCIs Save Lives**

Those outlets with "Test" and "Reset" buttons detect when electricity is going where it shouldn't—like through you—and cut power in milliseconds.

**Rule:** Power tools on a construction site should be plugged into GFCI-protected outlets.

**Extension Cords: The Limits**

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Daisy-chain cords | Use one cord of appropriate length |
| Run under rugs or through doorways | Route along walls, out of walkways |
| Use indoor cords outside | Check the rating—outdoor cords are marked |
| Overload with multiple tools | One heavy tool per cord |
| Leave coiled while in use | Uncoil fully to prevent heat buildup |

#### What to Do If...

**You Find Exposed Wiring:**
1. Move away from the area
2. Tell others to stay clear
3. Find your site lead immediately
4. Don't assume "it's probably not live"

**A Cord Gets Damaged:**
1. Don't use it
2. Don't try to tape it (tape is not a repair)
3. Tell your site lead so it can be replaced

**Someone Gets Shocked:**
1. Don't touch them — you'll get shocked too
2. Kill the power if you can reach the plug or breaker safely
3. If you can't reach power safely, use something non-conductive to push/pull them away
4. Call 911
5. Start CPR if they're not breathing and you're trained

#### Overhead Powerlines

- Stay at least 10 feet away with tools, ladders, and materials
- Look up before raising ladders or carrying long materials
- If equipment contacts a line: stay in equipment if possible, call for help

#### Quick Reference

- Wet + electrical = stop
- GFCI outlets = required for power tools
- One tool per extension cord
- Damaged cord = don't use, report it
- Exposed wires = back away, tell site lead
- Powerlines = 10 feet minimum clearance
- Someone shocked = cut power, call 911

**OSHA Reference:** 29 CFR 1926.400-449

### 2.7 Heat Safety (Page 10)

**Erratum ID:** ERR-GAP-005 | **Priority:** P0

#### Heat Safety — Water, Rest, Shade

The manual has zero coverage of heat-related hazards.

- 50-70% of outdoor heat fatalities occur in the first few days of working in hot conditions
- New volunteers—people without heat acclimatization—are at highest risk
- Heat illness escalates fast: you can go from "a little tired" to medical emergency in under an hour

#### The Three Rules

**Water**

Drink before you're thirsty. Once you feel thirsty, you're already dehydrated.

| Condition | How Much |
|-----------|----------|
| Moderate heat | 1 cup every 15-20 minutes |
| High heat or heavy work | 1 cup every 10-15 minutes |

Not soda. Not energy drinks. Water.

**Rest**

Take breaks before you're exhausted.

| Condition | Break Frequency |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Under 80°F | Regular work rhythm |
| 80-90°F | Break every 30-45 minutes in shade |
| Over 90°F | Break every 20-30 minutes in shade |
| Heat index over 100°F | Consider stopping or significantly reducing work |

**Shade**

When you rest, get out of the sun completely. Not partial shade—real shade.

#### Warning Signs

**Heat Exhaustion** (body overheating but can recover):
- Heavy sweating
- Cold, pale, clammy skin
- Weak, rapid pulse
- Nausea, muscle cramps, fatigue, dizziness

**What to do:** Move to shade, lie down with legs elevated, apply cool cloths, sip water. Get medical help if symptoms worsen or don't improve in 30 minutes.

**Heat Stroke — MEDICAL EMERGENCY:**
- High body temperature (103°F+)
- Hot, red, dry skin (stopped sweating)
- Rapid, strong pulse
- Confusion or unconsciousness

**What to do:**
1. Call 911 immediately
2. Move to coolest available area
3. Cool them aggressively (water, ice, fanning)
4. Do NOT give fluids if unconscious or confused
5. Stay with them until help arrives

#### Who's Most at Risk

- New to heat work — first few days
- Not acclimated — haven't been working outdoors regularly
- Taking certain medications
- Didn't sleep well — fatigue reduces heat tolerance
- Hungover or starting dehydrated

#### Quick Reference

| | What To Do |
|---|------------|
| Prevention | Water every 15-20 min. Shade breaks every 30-45 min in heat. |
| Heat Exhaustion | Shade, lie down, cool cloths, sip water. Get help if not improving. |
| Heat Stroke | **911 NOW.** Cool them aggressively. Don't give fluids if confused. |

**The Permission:** Nobody will think less of you for taking a water break or sitting in the shade. What they will think less of is someone who pushes through warning signs and ends up in an ambulance.

**OSHA Reference:** General Duty Clause; Heat NEP (National Emphasis Program)
