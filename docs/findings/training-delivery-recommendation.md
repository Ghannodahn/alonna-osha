# Training Delivery Recommendation

**Document Date:** January 2026
**Status:** Final
**Purpose:** Actionable recommendations for volunteer safety training delivery

---

## Executive Summary

This document synthesizes research findings into actionable recommendations for delivering OSHA safety training to volunteer construction workers. The recommendations address five core areas: modality mix, handbook specifications, digital companion priorities, facilitation guidelines, and success metrics.

**The central insight:** Volunteers forget 70-80% of orientation content within 24 hours. Effective training isn't about front-loading information—it's about creating a multi-layered system that delivers the right information at the right moment through the right channel.

### Key Recommendations at a Glance

| Area | Primary Recommendation |
|------|----------------------|
| **Modality Mix** | Multi-layered: Point-of-use (Quick Hits) → Reference (Been There) → Deep dive (Digital) |
| **Handbook** | 40-page task-based structure with tear-out quick references and QR bridge to digital |
| **Digital Tools** | PWA-first, offline-capable, QR-accessible with video demos and knowledge checks |
| **Facilitation** | Peer-led, 10-minute toolbox talks, buddy system, just-in-time delivery |
| **Success Metrics** | Information findability, knowledge recall, handbook usage, facilitator ease |

## Part 1: Recommended Modality Mix

### The Three-Layer Architecture

Training delivery should follow a progressive depth model where each layer serves a distinct purpose:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     LAYER 1: POINT-OF-USE                       │
│                     Quick Hits Tone                              │
│                                                                 │
│   Delivery: Pocket cards, signage, verbal 30-second briefings   │
│   When: At the ladder, tool, task—moment of need                │
│   Purpose: Activation reminder, zero recall required            │
│   Format: Visual-first, < 30 seconds to scan                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↑
                              │ "Need more detail"
                              │
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     LAYER 2: REFERENCE                          │
│                     Been There Tone                              │
│                                                                 │
│   Delivery: Handbook pages, morning briefings, toolbox talks    │
│   When: Before task, orientation, supervisor conversations      │
│   Purpose: Understanding with context, peer-to-peer connection  │
│   Format: 2-3 minute reads, story-driven                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↑
                              │ "Want to understand deeply"
                              │
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     LAYER 3: DEEP DIVE                          │
│                     Let's Figure This Out + Real Consequences   │
│                                                                 │
│   Delivery: PWA topic pages, video demos, scenario walkthroughs │
│   When: Training prep, curious learners, facilitator reference  │
│   Purpose: Full comprehension, visual demonstration, practice   │
│   Format: Multi-modal, interactive, self-paced                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Part 4: Facilitation Guidelines

### Facilitation Model: Peer-Led

Training is delivered by experienced volunteers training newer volunteers—peer-led, not expert-led.

**Why peer-led works:**
- Trust is higher (learners relate to peers)
- Relevance is immediate (same work context)
- Barriers are lower (asking questions feels safer)
- Knowledge sticks better (teaching reinforces learning)

### How Peer-Led Differs from Expert-Led

| Aspect | Expert-Led | Peer-Led |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Authority source** | Credentials | Shared experience |
| **Communication style** | One-way transfer | Two-way dialogue |
| **Knowledge framing** | "Here's what you need to know" | "Here's what I learned" |
| **Mistake handling** | Expert corrects | Group problem-solves |

### Optimal Group Sizes

| Setting | Size | Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Hands-on demonstrations** | 4-6 volunteers | Everyone can see, ask, practice |
| **Discussion-based sessions** | 3-4 volunteers | Small enough for everyone to contribute |
| **Morning briefings** | 5-8 volunteers | Short delivery, move to smaller groups |
| **Large groups (10+)** | Break into smaller groups | Assign peer facilitators per group |

### Optimal Session Lengths

| Content Type | Duration | Notes |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| **Single safety point** | 5-7 minutes | One concept = one session |
| **Topic overview** | 15-20 minutes max | 3-4 chunks with activities |
| **Hands-on practice** | 20-30 minutes | Active participation extends attention |
| **Comprehensive orientation** | Never exceed 45 minutes | Better: multiple 15-20 min sessions |

### Toolbox Talk Structure (10 Minutes)

```
TOOLBOX TALK TEMPLATE

1. TODAY'S FOCUS (2 min)
   - One specific hazard relevant to today's work
   - "Today we're working on [X], so let's talk about..."

2. THE STORY (3 min)
   - Brief "Been There" narrative
   - Real incident or realistic scenario

3. KEY POINTS (2 min)
   - 3 maximum action items
   - What specifically to do/not do
   - Demonstrate where applicable

4. DISCUSSION (2 min)
   - "What questions do you have?"
   - "Has anyone seen this type of hazard?"
   - "What would you do if...?"

5. CLOSE (1 min)
   - Recap 3 key points
   - "Who can I check in with if I'm unsure?"
```

### The Four-Step Demonstration Method

**Step 1: Prepare**
- Put learner at ease
- State the task, find out what they know
- Create motivation: "Here's why this matters"
- Position them to see clearly

**Step 2: Present/Demonstrate**
- Show step by step
- Explain each step as you do it
- Emphasize key points and reasons
- Go slowly

**Step 3: Try Out**
- Have learner do it while you watch
- Have them explain as they go
- Correct errors immediately (kindly)
- Repeat until correct

**Step 4: Follow Up**
- Let them practice independently
- Check back frequently at first
- Gradually reduce oversight
- Make clear who to ask for help

### Simpler Alternative: "I Do, We Do, You Do"

1. **I Do:** Facilitator demonstrates while explaining
2. **We Do:** Facilitator guides learner through together
3. **You Do:** Learner does independently, facilitator observes

### Peer Facilitator Language Guide

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---------------|--------|
| "The correct way is..." | "The way I learned to do this is..." |
| "You must always..." | "What works for me is..." |
| "That's wrong" | "Let me show you what happened when I tried it that way..." |
| "Any questions?" | "What would make this easier for you?" |

### Buddy System Protocol

Every first-time volunteer is paired with an experienced volunteer.

**Buddy responsibilities:**
| Function | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **Monitoring** | Watch for distress, fatigue, unsafe behavior |
| **Advising** | Alert buddy to hazards they haven't noticed |
| **Rescue** | Immediate assistance if trapped/injured |
| **Reporting** | Alert appropriate persons if accident occurs |
| **Psychological safety** | Create space for questions without judgment |

**Specific applications:**
| Scenario | Buddy Application |
|----------|-------------------|
| First-time volunteers | Pair with experienced volunteer |
| Ladder work | One climbs, one holds/watches |
| Working at height | Designated ground observer |
| Heavy lifting | Built-in team lift partner |
| Heat exposure | Mutual monitoring for illness signs |

### Engagement Techniques

**Quick techniques (1-3 minutes):**

| Technique | How It Works |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Think-Pair-Share** | Pose question → 30 sec individual think → 1 min pair discuss → share |
| **Turn and Talk** | "Turn to person next to you and discuss..." |
| **Show of Hands** | "Raise hand if you've ever..." / "Stand if you agree..." |
| **Prediction Prompt** | "Before I show you, what do you think will happen if...?" |

**Engagement frequency:** Every 5-7 minutes minimum

### Q&A Handling

**The 4-Step Process:**
1. **Listen:** Full attention, let them finish
2. **Process:** Pause, then Repeat/Reframe/Refocus if unclear
3. **Respond:** Concise answer, eye contact with whole group
4. **Refocus:** "Who else has a question?" (shift attention from questioner)

**Handling difficult questions:**

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Don't know answer | "Good question. Let me find out and get back to you." |
| Challenges credibility | "Fair point. My experience has been [X]—what do others think?" |
| Hostile question | Stay calm. "I hear this is frustrating. Here's what I can tell you..." |
| Off-topic | "Interesting—let me note it. For now, let's focus on [topic]." |

### Difficult Participant Strategies

| Type | Strategies |
|------|------------|
| **Dominator** | Time limits, structured activities, break eye contact, direct questions elsewhere |
| **Know-It-All** | Acknowledge experience, channel their knowledge, redirect gently |
| **Skeptic** | Don't get defensive, acknowledge concern, find common ground |
| **Silent Observer** | Pair discussions, written responses before verbal, gentle direct invitation |
| **Distracted** | Move closer, increase engagement, direct question to them |

### Supporting Peer Facilitators

**Before facilitation:**
- Clear content (talking points, not scripts)
- Practice opportunities
- Observation of experienced facilitators
- Knowledge of escalation contacts

**During facilitation:**
- Backup support available
- Materials/equipment ready
- Authority to adapt content
- Freedom to share personal experience

**After facilitation:**
- Feedback on performance
- Opportunity to share what worked
- Recognition for contribution
- Continued learning opportunities

### Just-in-Time Delivery Protocol

Deliver safety information at point of use, not hours before in orientation.

| Task | Just-in-Time Delivery |
|------|----------------------|
| Ladder work | 30-second briefing at ladder: "4:1 ratio, 3-point contact, someone watching" |
| Lifting | Quick verbal at the load: "Get close, test weight, ask for help" |
| Working at height | At platform: "What's above? Below? Who knows you're up here?" |
| Power tools | Before handing over: "Guards in place? Where are fingers going?" |

### Retention Integration: Sample Build Day

| Time | Strategy |
|------|----------|
| **Pre-arrival** | Text/email with key points from last visit |
| **Arrival** | Pair new volunteers with experienced (buddy system) |
| **Morning briefing** | 10-minute toolbox talk with narrative and discussion |
| **Task assignment** | Just-in-time specific safety points for assigned task |
| **During work** | Point-of-use signage at hazard locations |
| **During work** | Buddy system mutual monitoring |
| **Mid-morning** | Quick engagement (spot the hazard) during water break |
| **Afternoon start** | Re-brief for new tasks |
| **End of day** | Debrief—what to remember for next time |
| **Post-departure** | Follow-up message within 24-48 hours |

## Part 5: Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Time to find info** | < 15 seconds | Observation during training | Per orientation |
| **Key point recall** | 3/5 points end of day | Quick verbal quiz | Daily |
| **Handbook actually used** | 70%+ reference it | Observation on site | Weekly |
| **QR code scans** | Baseline + 20% growth | Analytics (Phase 2) | Monthly |
| **Video completion rate** | 50%+ watch full video | Video analytics | Monthly |
| **Quiz attempt rate** | 70%+ attempt knowledge check | PWA analytics | Monthly |

### Qualitative Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Volunteer confidence** | 4/5 "I know where to find answers" | Post-build survey | Per build |
| **Supervisor ease** | 4/5 "Easy to teach from" | Supervisor survey | Monthly |
| **Content clarity** | "Understood the topic" | Survey + quiz performance | Per build |
| **Accessibility feedback** | "Audio/video helpful" | Survey | Quarterly |

### Facilitation Quality Indicators

| Indicator | Positive Sign | Warning Sign |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Participant engagement** | Questions asked throughout | Silent, disengaged body language |
| **Time management** | Sessions finish on time | Consistently running over |
| **Knowledge transfer** | Volunteers can demonstrate | Same questions repeatedly |
| **Facilitator confidence** | Comfortable adapting content | Reading unfamiliar material |
| **Content consistency** | Key points delivered uniformly | Varying information across sessions |

### Peer Observation Protocol

Simple development process for peer facilitators:

1. **Observe** another facilitator before leading
2. **Be observed** during first few sessions
3. **Give/receive feedback:**
   - What worked well?
   - What could improve?
   - What questions did participants ask?
4. **Rotate partners** for diverse perspectives

### Review Cadence

| Review | Frequency | Focus |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Daily debrief** | End of each build day | What worked, what didn't, questions raised |
| **Weekly summary** | Friday | Patterns across days, facilitator support needs |
| **Monthly review** | First week of month | Metrics review, content updates needed |
| **Quarterly audit** | Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 | Major content refresh, print updates, strategy adjustment |

## Summary: The Five Pillars

### 1. Multi-Layered Delivery

Don't choose between print and digital—use both. Point-of-use cards activate memory; handbook builds understanding; digital enables depth.

### 2. Task-Based Organization

Organize around "what I'm about to do," not "what topic this falls under." Volunteers don't think in OSHA categories.

### 3. Peer-Led Facilitation

Experienced volunteers training newer volunteers. The "Been There" tone works because it's how peers actually talk.

### 4. Just-in-Time Reinforcement

Deliver at the ladder, not in orientation. Information at the point of use beats information in the classroom.

### 5. Continuous Measurement

Track what matters: Can they find information? Do they remember key points? Does the handbook actually get used? Are facilitators effective?
