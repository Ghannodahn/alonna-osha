# Learning Modalities and Accessibility Survey

**Document Date:** January 2026
**Status:** Final
**Goal:** No one left behind

## Executive Summary

This survey documents the four primary learning modalities and key accessibility considerations for OSHA safety training targeting volunteer construction workers. The findings ensure our safety content reaches learners regardless of their preferred learning style, language background, literacy level, or disability status.

**Core principle:** Multi-modal content isn't optional—it's essential. Over 70% of learners identify with more than one learning style, and our diverse volunteer population spans every accessibility consideration imaginable.

---

## The Four Learning Modalities (VARK)

The VARK model, developed by Neil Fleming in 1987, classifies learner preferences into four categories. For volunteer construction workers, each modality has specific applications to safety training.

### 1. Visual Learners (~30% of population)

**How they learn best:** Through images, diagrams, charts, demonstrations, and spatial relationships.

**Construction safety applications:**

| Format | Application | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Infographics** | Point-of-use safety reminders | Ladder safety quick reference card |
| **Diagrams** | Equipment setup and positioning | Proper scaffold assembly sequence |
| **Color coding** | Risk level identification | Red = stop, yellow = caution, green = safe |
| **Demonstrations** | Live modeling of techniques | Supervisor showing proper lifting form |
| **Before/after images** | Consequence visualization | Correct vs. incorrect PPE fit |
| **Flowcharts** | Decision processes | "Should I climb this ladder?" decision tree |

**Content design considerations:**
- Use consistent iconography throughout materials
- Pair text with supporting visuals
- Employ hierarchy through size and placement
- Include "what good looks like" reference images
- Leverage our Quick Hits tone for infographic text

**What doesn't work:**
- Dense text without visual breaks
- Verbal-only instructions
- Inconsistent symbology

---

### 2. Auditory Learners (~25% of population)

**How they learn best:** Through spoken explanation, discussion, stories, and verbal instruction.

**Construction safety applications:**

| Format | Application | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Verbal briefings** | Morning safety talk | "Today's hazard focus is..." |
| **Storytelling** | Experience-based learning | "Been There" tone narratives |
| **Discussion groups** | Collaborative problem-solving | "What would you do if...?" scenarios |
| **Audio recordings** | Podcast-style safety content | 2-minute audio safety tips |
| **Call-and-response** | Reinforcement technique | "What are the three points of contact?" |
| **Verbal cues** | On-site reminders | "Safety glasses, everyone!" |

**Content design considerations:**
- Use rhythm and repetition for key messages
- Incorporate the "Been There" tone—stories stick
- Allow time for verbal processing (pause after important points)
- Include discussion prompts for supervisors
- Provide audio versions of written materials where feasible

**What doesn't work:**
- Silent reading without discussion
- Overwhelming text with no verbal support
- Monotone delivery without vocal variation

---

### 3. Reading/Writing Learners (~15% of population)

**How they learn best:** Through written words—reading manuals, taking notes, making lists.

**Construction safety applications:**

| Format | Application | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Checklists** | Task completion verification | Pre-use ladder inspection checklist |
| **Written guides** | Reference materials | Pocket safety handbook |
| **Note-taking** | Personal engagement | Blank space in materials for notes |
| **Quizzes** | Self-assessment | "Check your understanding" questions |
| **Written instructions** | Step-by-step procedures | Tool-specific safety protocols |
| **Glossaries** | Terminology reference | OSHA terms defined plainly |

**Content design considerations:**
- Provide written summaries of verbal presentations
- Include glossaries for technical terms
- Offer take-home materials for later review
- Use numbered steps and clear formatting
- Balance brevity with completeness

**What doesn't work:**
- Audio-only content with no transcript
- Demonstrations without written follow-up
- Overwhelming amounts of text at once

---

### 4. Kinesthetic Learners (~30% of population)

**How they learn best:** Through hands-on experience, physical practice, and real-world application.

**Construction safety applications:**

| Format | Application | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Hands-on practice** | Skill development | PPE fitting under supervision |
| **Simulations** | Safe mistake environment | Practice ladder setup before jobsite |
| **Role-playing** | Scenario rehearsal | "You see a safety hazard—what do you do?" |
| **Tool familiarization** | Tactile learning | Handle equipment before using it |
| **Physical demonstrations** | Movement memory | Practice proper lifting technique |
| **On-the-job coaching** | Just-in-time learning | Supervisor correction in the moment |

**Content design considerations:**
- Pair every presentation with a hands-on component
- Use "show me" verification before task assignment
- Create safe practice environments for high-risk skills
- Incorporate physical movement into orientation (not just sitting)
- Design for spaced repetition (day 1, day 2, week 2)

**What doesn't work:**
- Lecture-only orientation
- "Tell them once and assume they got it"
- Written exams without practical demonstration

---

## Multi-Modal Content Strategy

### The Case for Multi-Modal

**Research supports it:**
- Over 70% of learners identify with more than one learning style
- Same message, multiple channels = better retention
- Accommodates preference shifts based on content complexity

**Volunteer population demands it:**
- Wide age range (18-70+)
- Varied educational backgrounds
- Some will be nervous; some will be overconfident
- No way to pre-assess preferences at scale

### Content Delivery Matrix

| Safety Topic | Visual | Auditory | Reading/Writing | Kinesthetic |
|--------------|--------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| PPE requirements | Infographic showing each item | Verbal briefing on "why" | Checklist to verify fit | Try on and adjust each item |
| Ladder safety | Diagram of 4:1 ratio | Story about fall incident | Written 3-point rule | Practice setup supervised |
| Manual handling | Before/after posture image | Verbal cues during lift | Lifting steps checklist | Supervised practice lift |
| Tool safety | Photo of correct grip | Explanation of hazards | Quick reference card | Handle before use |
| Emergency procedures | Exit route map | Verbal walkthrough | Written contact list | Walk the route |

### Recommended Content Package Per Topic

For each major safety topic, produce:

1. **Quick Hits infographic** (visual + reading/writing)
2. **"Been There" narrative** (auditory, via supervisor or audio)
3. **Pocket checklist** (reading/writing)
4. **Supervised practice protocol** (kinesthetic)
5. **Discussion questions** (auditory, collaborative)

## Accessibility Considerations

### ESL (English as Second Language) Learners

**The reality:**
- Hispanic workers experienced a 107.1% increase in fatal construction injuries between 2011-2022
- Language barriers are a leading factor in workplace injuries
- OSHA explicitly requires training in a language workers can understand

**OSHA regulatory position:**
> "If an employee does not speak or comprehend English, instruction must be provided in a language the employee can understand."

There is no OSHA requirement that communication be based on English. If employers regularly communicate work instructions in another language, safety training must follow the same pattern.

**Design strategies:**

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Visual-heavy content** | Reduce reliance on text; use universal symbols |
| **Bilingual materials** | Spanish/English versions of all critical content |
| **Simplified vocabulary** | Avoid idioms, jargon, complex sentence structures |
| **Demonstration emphasis** | Show, don't just tell |
| **Bilingual peer mentors** | Pair ESL workers with bilingual volunteers |
| **Picture-based checklists** | Icons representing each step |

**Content testing:**
- Have ESL speakers review materials before deployment
- Use reading level analyzers (aim for 5th-6th grade reading level)
- Test comprehension with "show me what you'd do" rather than verbal quizzes

---

### Varying Literacy Levels

**The reality:**
- Cannot assume any baseline literacy level
- 21% of U.S. adults have low literacy skills
- Construction volunteering attracts diverse educational backgrounds
- OSHA is clear: "If employees are not literate, telling them to read training materials will not satisfy the employer's training obligation"

**Design strategies:**

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Audio alternatives** | Every written piece has a spoken version |
| **Icon-based instructions** | Universally understood symbols |
| **Short sentences** | One idea per sentence; max 15 words |
| **Active voice** | "Wear your hard hat" not "Hard hats should be worn" |
| **Large, clear fonts** | Minimum 12pt; preferably 14pt for signage |
| **White space** | Avoid dense text blocks |
| **Verbal comprehension checks** | "Tell me what you'd do" not "Did you read the handout?" |

**Readability targets:**
- Primary content: 5th-6th grade reading level
- Signage: 3rd-4th grade reading level
- Never assume someone read anything—always verify verbally

---

### Hearing Impairments

**Range of considerations:**
- Profound deafness requiring sign language
- Hard of hearing benefiting from amplification
- Processing differences affecting auditory comprehension

**Design strategies:**

| Need | Solution |
|------|----------|
| Deaf workers | Visual-only instruction packages; ASL interpretation for orientation |
| Hard of hearing | Assistive listening devices; facing speaker; reduced background noise |
| Processing differences | Written backup of all verbal content; note-taking support |

**Universal Design principles applied:**

- **Captioning:** All video content captioned (benefits everyone—70% of Gen Z uses subtitles regardless of hearing status)
- **Visual alerts:** Supplement audio alarms with visual signals on jobsite
- **Face-to-face:** Ensure instructor faces workers when speaking (lipreading)
- **Written backup:** Handouts summarizing verbal presentations
- **Quiet briefing areas:** Reduce background noise during safety talks

**Emergency procedure adaptations:**
- Buddy system: Pair hearing-impaired workers with hearing partners for emergencies
- Visual alarms: Strobe lights supplement audio alarms
- Direct notification: Tap shoulder or visual signal for immediate attention

---

### Vision Impairments

**Range of considerations:**
- Low vision (can see with accommodations)
- Color blindness (affects ~8% of males)
- Legal blindness requiring alternative formats

**Design strategies:**

| Need | Solution |
|------|----------|
| Low vision | Large print materials; high contrast colors; matte surfaces (reduce glare) |
| Color blindness | Don't rely on color alone; use shapes + labels + colors together |
| Blindness | Audio descriptions; tactile demonstrations; verbal labeling of environment |

**Practical applications:**

- **Signage:** High contrast (black on yellow or white on blue); minimum 24pt font
- **Color coding:** Pair colors with shapes (red octagon = stop; yellow triangle = caution)
- **Materials:** Offer large-print versions of pocket references
- **Demonstrations:** Verbally describe what you're showing while you show it
- **Tool identification:** Tactile markers on equipment

---

### Neurodivergent Learners

**The reality:**
- 1 in 5 people are neurodivergent (autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, etc.)
- 32% of neurodivergent workers don't disclose in workplace settings
- Traditional training formats often create unnecessary barriers

**Universal accommodations that benefit everyone:**

| Accommodation | Neurodivergent Benefit | Universal Benefit |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Chunked content | Reduces cognitive overload | Easier to remember |
| Clear structure | Predictability reduces anxiety | Easier to navigate |
| Fidget tools available | Helps with focus | No downside |
| Quiet spaces | Sensory regulation | Welcomes introverts |
| Breaks built in | Prevents overwhelm | Maintains attention |
| Multiple formats | Accommodates processing differences | Reaches more learners |

**ADHD-specific considerations:**
- Short segments (max 10 minutes per topic)
- Interactive elements break passive listening
- Movement incorporated into training
- Clear "what to do NOW" takeaways
- Written follow-up (working memory support)

**Autism-specific considerations:**
- Predictable structure (agenda at start)
- Literal language (avoid sarcasm, idioms)
- Clear expectations stated explicitly
- Sensory-friendly environment
- Option for written questions vs. verbal

**Dyslexia-specific considerations:**
- Sans-serif fonts (Arial, Verdana)
- Left-aligned text (not justified)
- Cream or light-colored backgrounds (reduce contrast glare)
- Audio alternatives for all written content
- Extra time for reading tasks

**Design principle:**
> Design for the edges, and you'll improve the experience for everyone in the middle.

### Supervisor Training Requirements

Supervisors must be equipped to:

1. **Identify and adapt:** Recognize when a volunteer isn't understanding and try a different modality
2. **Verify comprehension:** Use "show me" instead of "do you understand?"
3. **Provide accommodations:** Know what alternatives exist and how to access them
4. **Respect privacy:** Accommodate without requiring disclosure of disability
5. **Model behavior:** Demonstrate what they expect, not just describe it

### Quality Assurance

Before deploying any content:

1. **Modality review:** Does it work for visual, auditory, reading/writing, AND kinesthetic learners?
2. **Language review:** Have ESL speakers reviewed for clarity?
3. **Literacy review:** Is it accessible at a 5th-grade reading level?
4. **Accessibility review:** Does it meet basic accessibility standards (contrast, font size, captioning)?
5. **Field test:** Has a real volunteer successfully learned from it?

## Summary: The "No One Left Behind" Commitment

| Learner Profile | Primary Accommodation | Backup Accommodation |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Visual learner | Infographics, diagrams | Demonstrations |
| Auditory learner | Verbal briefings, stories | Discussion groups |
| Reading/writing learner | Checklists, guides | Written summaries |
| Kinesthetic learner | Hands-on practice | Supervised demonstration |
| ESL speaker | Visual-heavy content | Bilingual materials, interpreters |
| Low literacy | Audio versions, icons | Verbal instruction, demonstration |
| Deaf/hard of hearing | Visual-only packages, captions | Written backup, visual alerts |
