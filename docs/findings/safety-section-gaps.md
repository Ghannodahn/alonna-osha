---

## 2. Insufficient Depth (Topics Present but Incomplete)

### 2.1 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

**Current Coverage**: Lists 8 PPE items (ear plugs, knee pads, safety glasses, dust mask, hard hat, safety vest, gloves, boots) — *back brace removed per NIOSH/OSHA guidance*

**Gaps**:
| Missing Element | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| When each item is required | Not all PPE needed for all tasks |
| How to inspect PPE | Damaged PPE may not protect |
| Proper fit requirements | Ill-fitting PPE fails |
| Care and storage | Degraded equipment |
| What "safety glasses" means | Distinction from regular glasses/sunglasses |

**OSHA Note**: 2025 rule requires PPE that "properly fits" construction workers (29 CFR 1926.95)

---

### 2.2 Lifting/Manual Handling

**Current Coverage**: "Always lift with your legs, not your back" (one sentence)

**Gaps**:
- No weight guidance or limits
- No team lift requirements
- No path planning before lifting
- No ergonomic positioning (close to body, no twisting)
- No mechanical assistance options (carts, dollies)
- No permission to ask for help ("Golden Rule" concept)

**Risk Level**: Important - Musculoskeletal disorders are a leading cause of construction injuries, with nearly half of workers reporting symptoms

---

### 2.3 Ladder Safety

**Current Coverage**: 7 bullet points covering basic requirements

**Gaps**:
| Missing Element | OSHA Requirement |
|-----------------|------------------|
| 4-to-1 ratio rule | Standard industry practice |
| 3-foot extension above landing | Required for roof access |
| Weight rating/selection | Must match user + materials |
| Setting up on uneven ground | Common volunteer site issue |
| Carrying materials while climbing | Should use rope/bucket |
| Wooden ladder inspection | Different criteria than metal |

**Risk Level**: Critical - Ladders are a leading cause of construction injuries

---

### 2.4 Hand Tool Safety

**Current Coverage**: 2 vague sentences

**Gaps**:
- No specific tool handling guidance
- No blade direction rules (cut away from body)
- No securing workpiece requirements
- No tool inspection criteria
- No struck-by-tool prevention

---

### 2.5 Power Tool Safety

**Current Coverage**: 3 bullet points; notes power tools "NOT allowed on walking sites"

**Gaps**:
- No guidance for sites where power tools ARE used
- No specific tool training requirements
- No guard/safety feature requirements
- No cord management beyond "check for damage"
- No lockout/tagout awareness

---

### 2.6 Treated Lumber Handling

**Current Coverage**: Brief mention of mask/gloves requirement

**Gaps**:
- No explanation of what chemicals are present
- No hand washing frequency guidance
- No scrap disposal requirements
- No distinction between old arsenic-treated and newer treatments

---

### 2.7 Fiberglass/Insulation

**Current Coverage**: "Baby powder on arms" recommendation

**Gaps**:
- No respiratory protection requirements
- No eye protection requirements
- No decontamination procedures
- No long-term exposure risks

---

### 2.8 First Aid

**Current Coverage**: "First aid kits will be located on the site or in the storage trailer"

**Gaps**:
- No location specifics (where exactly?)
- No contents overview
- No "what to do first" guidance
- No "when to escalate to 911" guidance
- No bloodborne pathogen awareness

---

## 3. Outdated or Ambiguous Guidance

### 3.1 "Common Sense" References

**Issue**: Handbook relies on "common sense" 3 times as safety guidance.
> "A little common sense goes a long way"
> "REMEMBER-ALWAYS EXERCISE CAUTION AND COMMON SENSE!"

**Problem**: "Common sense" varies by experience level. Volunteers lack construction context to know what's obvious.

**Fix**: Replace with specific, actionable guidance.

---

### ~~3.2 Back Brace Listed as Required PPE~~ **✓ RESOLVED (2026-01-16)**

~~**Issue**: Back braces are listed as required PPE.~~

~~**Current OSHA/NIOSH Position**: Back belts/braces have no proven injury prevention benefit and may create false confidence.~~

~~**Fix**: Remove from required list; focus on proper lifting technique instead.~~

**Resolution**: Back brace removed from PPE list. Proper lifting technique training recommended as replacement.

---

### 3.3 Ambiguous "Instructor" References

**Issue**: Multiple references to "notify the instructor" without defining who this is.
> "notify the instructor and site coordinator immediately"
> "always ask the instructor before you use it"

**Problem**: Volunteers may not know who the "instructor" is or where to find them.

**Fix**: Define roles clearly; use "supervisor" or "site lead" consistently.

---

### 3.4 Incomplete Cord Safety

**Current**: "Be sure to unsecure extension cords properly so they do not pull out"

**Problem**: This sentence is confusing - "unsecure" appears to be a typo for "secure"

**Fix**: Rewrite with clear guidance on cord strain relief and routing.

---

### 3.5 Vague Clothing Requirements

**Current**: "Clothing should not be loose fitting" + "long sleeved shirt, long pants"

**Problem**: These potentially conflict (long sleeves can be loose). No guidance on fit vs. coverage balance.

**Fix**: Clarify: "Fitted long sleeves and pants - protective but not baggy enough to catch on equipment"

---

### 3.6 Blanket PPE List vs. Task-Specific PPE

**Issue**: Lists 9 PPE items with no indication of when each is needed.

**Problem**: Creates confusion (do I wear all 9 items always?) and compliance fatigue.

**Fix**: Reorganize into:
- Always required (baseline)
- Task-specific (when doing X, add Y)
- Available as needed (optional based on comfort/conditions)

---

## 4. Tone and Format Issues (Enhancement Opportunities)

### 4.1 Compliance-First Language

**Pattern**: "must," "should be worn," "are required," "NOT allowed"

**Problem**: Creates resistance rather than buy-in; sounds like legal CYA

**Example**: "Safety glasses should always be worn on job sites"

**Better**: "Put on your safety glasses before picking up any tool. Your eyes don't get second chances."

---

### 4.2 Passive Voice Throughout

**Pattern**: Rules stated without clear actor or timing

**Example**: "A clean site is essential to work site safety"

**Better**: "Keep your work area clear. You'll trip over what you leave out."

---

### 4.3 ALL CAPS Lecturing

**Pattern**: Key warnings in ALL CAPS

**Example**: "NO DANGLY JEWELRY" / "REMEMBER-ALWAYS EXERCISE CAUTION"

**Problem**: Feels like being yelled at; undermines peer-to-peer tone

---

### 4.4 Missing "Why"

**Pattern**: Rules stated without explanation

**Example**: "Always maintain a 3-point contact on the ladder while climbing"

**Better**: "3-point contact (two hands + one foot, or two feet + one hand) keeps you stable if something shifts. It's why people don't fall."

---

### 4.5 Information Overload Structure

**Issue**: Dense bullet lists with no hierarchy or prioritization

**Problem**: If everything is equally important, nothing is

**Fix**: Lead with top 3 most critical points; group related items; use progressive disclosure

---

### 4.6 No Stories or Examples

**Issue**: All content is abstract rules

**Problem**: Stories are 22x more memorable than facts alone (Stanford research)

**Fix**: Add "Been There" scenarios showing why rules matter

---

### 4.7 No Visual References

**Issue**: Text-only presentation

**Problem**: ~30% of learners are primarily visual; demonstrations stick better than words

**Fix**: Add diagrams for key concepts (ladder angle, lifting posture, 3-point contact)

---

### 4.8 No Knowledge Verification

**Issue**: Information given but comprehension not checked

**Problem**: No way to know if message was understood before tools are used

**Fix**: Add "show me" checkpoints for critical skills

---

### 4.9 Legal Disclaimer Undermines Content

**Current**: "THERE IS NO WAY THIS BRIEF SUMMARY CAN COVER ALL THE SAFETY ISSUES ON A JOB SITE"

**Problem**: Immediately signals the training is incomplete; reduces perceived value

**Fix**: Replace with confidence-building close that directs volunteers to ask questions

---
