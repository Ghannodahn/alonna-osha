# Training Scenario Context

**Document Date:** January 2026
**Status:** Active Constraint
**Purpose:** Define the specific build scenario that guides content prioritization

---

## The Scenario

**Project:** Building a 10x16 shed inside a larger structure

**Time Constraint:** 15 minutes strict limit for safety training

---

## Scenario Implications

### What This Means for Content

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| **Indoor construction** | Weather/heat illness lower priority; confined space awareness higher |
| **Shed scale (10x16)** | Manageable heights (likely <10ft); focused material handling |
| **Inside larger structure** | Working around others critical; fall hazards from host structure |
| **15-minute limit** | Ruthless prioritization; no deep dives; point-of-use reinforcement |

### High-Priority Risks for This Scenario

Based on 10x16 shed construction inside a larger structure:

| Risk | Why It's Elevated | Training Focus |
|------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Manual handling** | Lumber, panels, roofing materials | Lifting technique, team lifts |
| **Working at heights** | Roof framing, siding | Ladder safety, fall awareness |
| **Working around others** | Shared space with host structure activity | Communication, "heads up" calls |
| **Hand/power tools** | Framing, fastening, cutting | PPE, guards, cord management |
| **Struck-by hazards** | Dropped materials, swinging lumber | Awareness, staging discipline |

### Lower-Priority for This Scenario

| Risk | Why It's Lower | Still Cover If... |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Heat illness** | Indoor/controlled environment | Outdoor staging area involved |
| **Electrical safety** | Limited scope in shed build | Running temp power |
| **Excavation/trenching** | Shed inside existing structure | Foundation work required |
| **Scaffolding** | Unlikely for 10x16 shed | Specified in scope |

## 15-Minute Session Design

### The Math

| Component | Time | Content |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Opening/hook | 1 min | "We're building a shed today. Here's what keeps us safe." |
| Core safety points | 8 min | 4 points × 2 min each (with visuals) |
| Quick demo | 3 min | One hands-on moment (lifting technique or ladder check) |
| Questions + close | 3 min | "What questions? Here's who to ask." |
| **Total** | **15 min** | |

### The Four Points (Recommended)

For a 10x16 shed inside a larger structure, prioritize:

1. **Lifting & Carrying** (2 min)
   - Get close, test weight, ask for help
   - Team lifts for anything awkward
   - "Your back doesn't heal like a broken board"

2. **Working at Heights** (2 min)
   - Ladder setup: 4:1 ratio, stable base
   - 3-point contact always
   - Someone knows you're up there

3. **Working Around Others** (2 min)
   - "Heads up!" before moving lumber
   - Know who's above and below you
   - Staging areas matter

4. **Tool Safety Essentials** (2 min)
   - PPE: glasses, gloves for the task
   - Guards stay on
   - "If it feels wrong, stop"

### What Gets Deferred to Point-of-Use

These don't need training time—deliver at the task:

| Topic | Point-of-Use Delivery |
|-------|----------------------|
| Specific tool operation | Demo at the tool station |
| Material hazards | Note at staging area |
| Emergency procedures | Posted + verbal at start |
| Detailed PPE fitting | Station before work begins |

## Content Streamlining Guidelines

### Include If...

- It's a realistic risk for shed construction
- Volunteers will encounter it today
- A 30-second explanation prevents real harm
- It's actionable ("do this, not that")

### Exclude If...

- It's theoretical for this scope
- It requires more than 2 minutes to explain
- It's better delivered point-of-use
- It applies to specialized tasks not in scope

### Language Priorities

| Prefer | Over |
|--------|------|
| "Get help for awkward loads" | OSHA weight limits |
| "Someone watches you on the ladder" | Fall protection regulations |
| "Call out before moving lumber" | Communication protocols |
| "If it feels wrong, stop and ask" | Detailed hazard assessment |

## Errata Relevance

When evaluating errata items, ask:

1. **Is this relevant to shed construction?** → If no, lower priority
2. **Can this be covered in under 60 seconds?** → If no, needs point-of-use
3. **Does this address a realistic risk for this scenario?** → Core filter
4. **Would a volunteer actually encounter this today?** → Immediacy test
