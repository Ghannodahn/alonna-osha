**Verdict:** ✅ **VERIFIED**

---

### Category 3: Partially Accurate Claims (Needs Revision)

#### Claim 10: Struck-By Hazards = 17%

**Claim (Line 50):** "Struck-by hazards caused 17% of construction deaths in recent years"

**Verification:**
- **NIOSH Historical Data (2011-2021):** Struck-by injuries accounted for approximately 17% of fatal injuries in construction.
- **2023 BLS Data:** Struck-by hazards accounted for approximately 8-10% of construction fatalities in 2023.

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY ACCURATE**

**Issue:** The 17% figure is historical (2011-2021 average). Recent 2023 data shows lower percentages (~8-10%).

**Recommended Revision:**
> Change: "caused 17% of construction deaths in recent years"
> To: "historically accounted for approximately 17% of construction fatalities (2011-2021 NIOSH data); more recent single-year data shows ~8-10%"

---

#### Claim 11: Musculoskeletal Disorders = 52% of Illness

**Claim (Line 201):** "Musculoskeletal disorders account for 52% of construction work-related illness"

**Verification:**
- **BLS Data:** MSDs account for approximately 30% of DAFW (days away from work) cases in the private sector overall.
- **Construction-Specific:** Over 20% of nonfatal injuries in construction result from MSDs.
- **52% Figure:** This percentage appears in nursing assistant statistics, not construction-specific data.

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY ACCURATE / NEEDS SOURCE**

**Issue:** The 52% figure could not be verified for construction specifically. Available BLS data suggests different percentages.

**Recommended Revision:**
> Change: "Musculoskeletal disorders account for 52% of construction work-related illness"
> To: "Musculoskeletal disorders account for over 20% of nonfatal construction injuries (BLS SOII), with approximately 50% of construction workers experiencing recurrent musculoskeletal pain during their careers"

---

#### Claim 12: Caught-In/Between = ~6%

**Claim (Line 62):** "Caught-in/between accounts for ~6% of construction fatalities"

**Verification:**
- **2023 Data:** Caught-in/between incidents accounted for approximately 5% (54 deaths) of all construction fatalities in 2023.
- **Cited Reference:** 29 CFR 1926.650-652 (trenching/excavation) is relevant.

**Verdict:** ✅ **VERIFIED** - The "~6%" approximation is reasonably accurate (actual 5%).

---

## Gap Priority Alignment Analysis

The document identifies gaps and assigns priority levels. Here is the verification that these priorities align with regulatory importance:

### Priority Alignment: ✅ WELL-ALIGNED

| Document Priority | Gap Topic | Regulatory Basis | Alignment |
|------------------|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| **Critical** | Fall Protection Beyond Ladders | #1 cited OSHA violation; 39% of fatalities | ✅ Appropriate |
| **Critical** | Struck-By Hazards | Focus Four hazard; 8-17% of fatalities | ✅ Appropriate |
| **Critical** | Electrical Safety | Focus Four hazard; 8% of fatalities | ✅ Appropriate |
| **Important** | Caught-In/Between | Focus Four hazard; 5-6% of fatalities | ✅ Appropriate |
| **Important** | Heat Illness | OSHA NEP priority; high volunteer risk | ✅ Appropriate |
| **Important** | Emergency Procedures | General Duty Clause compliance | ✅ Appropriate |
| **Moderate** | Silica/Dust Hazards | 29 CFR 1926.1153 applies | ✅ Appropriate |
| **Moderate** | Scaffold Safety | 29 CFR 1926.450-454 applies | ✅ Appropriate |

### Summary of Priority Alignment

The document correctly:
1. Prioritizes Focus Four hazards (falls, struck-by, caught-in/between, electrocution) as Critical/Important
2. Elevates heat illness to Important status reflecting OSHA's National Emphasis Program
3. Positions silica and scaffold safety as Moderate, reflecting their conditional applicability to volunteer sites
4. Correctly identifies that the current handbook covers only ~40% of essential safety topics

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Corrections Needed

1. **Struck-By Percentage (Line 50):** Update to clarify historical vs. current data
2. **MSD Percentage (Line 201):** Replace 52% with verifiable BLS construction statistics

### No Changes Needed

All other claims, statistics, and regulatory references are accurate and appropriately cited.

### Document Strengths

- Accurate Focus Four hazard percentages
- Correct OSHA CFR citations throughout
- Appropriate gap priority assignments aligned with regulatory importance
- Accurate representation of OSHA/NIOSH positions on back braces
- Correct citation of the 2025 PPE fit rule
