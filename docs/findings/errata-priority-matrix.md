# Errata Priority Matrix

## Purpose

This matrix ranks identified safety content gaps to determine which errata to develop first. Not everything requires immediate attention - this prioritization ensures effort goes toward issues that matter most.

---

## Scoring Methodology

Each gap is evaluated on four dimensions (1-5 scale):

| Dimension | Score 1 | Score 3 | Score 5 |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Injury Severity** | Minor (scrapes, bruises) | Moderate (sprains, cuts requiring care) | Severe (fractures, fatalities, permanent injury) |
| **Incident Frequency** | Rare (< 1% of volunteers) | Occasional (1-5% of volunteers) | Common (> 5% of volunteers or daily exposure) |
| **Volunteer Confusion** | Rarely misunderstood | Sometimes confusing | Frequent questions or misapplication |
| **Ease of Addressing** | Requires major restructuring or external resources | Moderate effort (new section, research needed) | Quick fix (clarification, rewording, simple addition) |

**Composite Score** = (Severity x 2) + Frequency + Confusion + (6 - Ease)

*Note: Ease is inverted - easier fixes score higher because they offer better ROI.*

## Priority Tier Summary

| Tier | Composite Score | Recommendation | Count |
|------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| **P0: Critical** | 18+ | Address before next volunteer event | 5 |
| **P1: High** | 14-17 | Complete within 30 days | 7 |
| **P2: Medium** | 10-13 | Complete within 90 days | 8 |
| **P3: Low** | < 10 | Nice-to-have; address as resources allow | 6 |
| **Skip** | - | Not worth addressing; minimal impact | 4 |

---

## P0: Critical Priority (Do First)

These gaps represent high-severity hazards with poor or missing coverage. Address before the next volunteer event.

| Gap | Severity | Frequency | Confusion | Ease | **Total** | Content Status |
|-----|----------|-----------|-----------|------|-----------|----------------|
| **1. Electrical Safety** | 5 | 3 | 4 | 3 | **20** | Missing entirely |
| **2. Fall Protection (beyond ladders)** | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | **20** | Missing entirely |
| **3. Emergency Procedures** | 5 | 2 | 5 | 4 | **19** | Vague reference only |
| **4. Struck-By/Working Above-Below** | 5 | 3 | 3 | 4 | **18** | Discovery doc ready |
| **5. Heat Illness Prevention** | 5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | **18** | Missing entirely |

### Rationale

1. **Electrical Safety (Score: 20)**: Zero coverage of a Focus Four hazard. Electrocution causes 8% of construction fatalities. Volunteers encounter extension cords, power tools, and temporary power daily. One sentence about "check cords for damage" is not safety guidance.

2. **Fall Protection Beyond Ladders (Score: 20)**: Falls are #1 cause of construction deaths (39%). Handbook covers ladders but ignores 6-foot rule, scaffold basics, edge hazards, and guardrails. Volunteers may encounter elevated surfaces without understanding risks.

3. **Emergency Procedures (Score: 19)**: Current guidance: "notify the instructor and site coordinator immediately." No exit locations, assembly points, emergency numbers, or chain of command. During an actual emergency, this guidance is useless.

4. **Struck-By/Working Above-Below (Score: 18)**: ~10% of construction fatalities (2023 BLS). No mention of hard hat zones, drop zones, tool tethering, or communication protocols. Discovery document (09-working-above-below.md) has content ready for integration.

5. **Heat Illness Prevention (Score: 18)**: Zero coverage. 50-70% of outdoor heat fatalities occur in first few days of exposure - exactly the profile of volunteers. Becoming an OSHA enforcement priority. Seasonal but critical.

---

## P1: High Priority (30-Day Target)

Important gaps that affect safety but aren't immediately life-threatening, or have content partially ready.

| Gap | Severity | Frequency | Confusion | Ease | **Total** | Content Status |
|-----|----------|-----------|-----------|------|-----------|----------------|
| **6. Manual Handling/Lifting** | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | **17** | Discovery doc ready |
| **7. PPE - When/Why/How** | 3 | 5 | 5 | 4 | **16** | Needs restructuring |
| **8. Job Hazard Analysis Thinking** | 3 | 5 | 4 | 3 | **16** | Discovery doc ready |
| **9. Ladder Safety Expansion** | 5 | 4 | 2 | 3 | **16** | Framework ready |
| **10. Role Clarity (Who is "Instructor"?)** | 2 | 5 | 5 | 5 | **15** | Simple fix |
| **11. Incident Reporting Guidance** | 2 | 3 | 4 | 4 | **14** | Missing entirely |
| **12. First Aid Specifics** | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 | **14** | Vague reference only |

### Rationale

6. **Manual Handling (Score: 17)**: "Lift with legs, not back" is insufficient. MSDs are a leading cause of construction injuries, with nearly half of workers reporting symptoms. Discovery document 07-manual-handling-golden-rule.md has comprehensive content ready.

7. **PPE Section (Score: 16)**: Lists 9 items without context. Creates confusion (do I wear all 9 always?) and compliance fatigue. Needs restructuring into baseline/task-specific/optional.

8. **JHA Thinking (Score: 16)**: Most injuries happen when workers don't anticipate hazards. No pre-task assessment guidance exists. Discovery document 08-job-hazard-analysis.md has content ready.

9. **Ladder Safety Expansion (Score: 16)**: Good foundation exists but missing: 4-to-1 ratio, 3-foot extension rule, weight ratings, setup on uneven ground. Content framework is ready; needs completion.

10. **Role Clarity (Score: 15)**: "Notify the instructor" appears multiple times. Who is that person? Where are they? Easy fix with high confusion reduction.

11. **Incident Reporting (Score: 14)**: No guidance on what to report, when, or why it matters. Affects organizational learning.

12. **First Aid Specifics (Score: 14)**: "First aid kits will be located on site or in the storage trailer" - where exactly? What's inside? When to escalate?

---

## P2: Medium Priority (90-Day Target)

Gaps that improve safety but have lower severity or frequency.

| Gap | Severity | Frequency | Confusion | Ease | **Total** | Content Status |
|-----|----------|-----------|-----------|------|-----------|----------------|
| **13. Hand Tool Specifics** | 3 | 4 | 3 | 3 | **13** | Vague guidance |
| **14. Power Tool Guidance** | 4 | 2 | 3 | 3 | **13** | Site-dependent |
| **15. Caught-In/Between Hazards** | 4 | 2 | 3 | 3 | **13** | Missing entirely |
| **16. Cord Safety Clarification** | 3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | **12** | Has typo/confusion |
| **17. Communication Protocols** | 2 | 5 | 3 | 4 | **12** | Missing entirely |
| **18. Silica/Dust Hazards** | 4 | 2 | 3 | 3 | **12** | Brief mention only |
| **19. Housekeeping Standards** | 2 | 4 | 2 | 4 | **11** | Exists but incomplete |
| **20. Scaffold Safety Basics** | 5 | 1 | 2 | 2 | **11** | Missing entirely |

### Rationale

13. **Hand Tool Specifics (Score: 13)**: Current guidance has 2 vague sentences. Needs blade direction, securing workpiece, tool inspection criteria.

14. **Power Tool Guidance (Score: 13)**: "NOT allowed on walking sites" but what about other sites? Training requirements, guard usage, authorization process needed.

15. **Caught-In/Between (Score: 13)**: Focus Four hazard (6% of fatalities) but lower frequency in volunteer work. Still needs coverage.

16. **Cord Safety (Score: 12)**: Current text says "unsecure extension cords properly" - confusing typo. Easy fix.

17. **Communication Protocols (Score: 12)**: No "heads up" / "below!" guidance. Important for site safety but lower severity.

18. **Silica/Dust (Score: 12)**: Only mentioned for treated lumber. Concrete/masonry cutting creates silica exposure requiring different protection.

19. **Housekeeping Standards (Score: 11)**: Exists but missing specifics: nail removal, stacking heights, path widths.

20. **Scaffold Safety (Score: 11)**: High severity but very low frequency in volunteer work. Include basic awareness only.

## P3: Low Priority (As Resources Allow)

Tone, format, and enhancement issues that improve quality but don't directly prevent injuries.

| Gap | Severity | Frequency | Confusion | Ease | **Total** | Notes |
|-----|----------|-----------|-----------|------|-----------|-------|
| **21. Passive Voice Throughout** | 1 | 5 | 2 | 2 | **9** | Tone issue |
| **22. Compliance-First Language** | 1 | 5 | 2 | 2 | **9** | Tone issue |
| **23. ALL CAPS Lecturing** | 1 | 3 | 2 | 5 | **8** | Easy fix but low impact |
| **24. Fiberglass/Insulation Detail** | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | **8** | Low frequency |
| **25. Treated Lumber Detail** | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | **8** | Low frequency |
| **26. Visual Aids Addition** | 1 | 5 | 3 | 1 | **8** | Requires graphics work |

### Rationale

These issues affect training quality and volunteer buy-in but don't directly cause injuries. Address after safety-critical gaps are closed.

---

## Skip: Not Worth Addressing

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| ~~**Back brace as required PPE**~~ | ~~Remove from list entirely per OSHA/NIOSH guidance. Simple deletion, not content development.~~ ✅ **DONE 2026-01-16** |
| **Legal disclaimer tone** | Annoying but not a safety issue. Can be reworded when doing general tone pass. |
| **Information overload structure** | Systemic issue that resolves when individual sections are rewritten. |
| **Missing stories/examples** | Nice-to-have that can be added incrementally. Not a gap, just an enhancement. |
