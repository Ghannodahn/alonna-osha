# Safety Content Coverage Analysis

## Purpose

This document analyzes what safety topics **ARE** covered in the Building Beyond the Walls handbook, mapping existing content to OSHA standards and assessing coverage depth. This complements the [gap analysis](safety-section-gaps.md) by documenting what exists (not just what's missing).

|-------|-----------|
| Electrical Safety | No GFCI, wet conditions, or live wire content |
| Fall Protection | Only ladders; no scaffold, edge, or hole content |
| Emergency Response | Only "notify instructor"; no 29 CFR 1926.50 compliance |
| Heat Illness | Zero content; OSHA NEP priority |
| Struck-By Hazards | Zero content; Focus Four hazard |

## Content Quality Assessment

### Effective Elements

1. **3-Point Contact Explanation**: Ladder section clearly explains the two configurations (2 hands + 1 foot OR 2 feet + 1 hand)

2. **Tool Restrictions**: Unambiguous language ("We do not use...") with organization name reinforces policy

3. **Table Saw Warning**: "One of the most dangerous tools on the jobsite" is appropriately emphatic

4. **Fiberglass Practical Tip**: "Baby powder on arms" is memorable and actionable

5. **Second-Person Ladder Requirement**: Exceeds OSHA minimum; organization-specific safety enhancement

### Problematic Elements

1. ~~**Back Brace Listed as PPE**: NIOSH/OSHA position is that back belts don't prevent injury~~ **✓ RESOLVED** - Removed from PPE list (2026-01-16)

2. **"Common Sense" Reliance**: Appears 3 times; ineffective for inexperienced workers

3. **Confusing Cord Sentence**: "Be sure to unsecure extension cords properly" (appears to be typo)

4. **Passive Voice**: "A clean site is essential" vs. "Keep your area clean"

5. **No Hierarchy**: All rules presented equally; no indication of critical vs. nice-to-have
