## Decision: Tone 2 (Been There) as Primary

### Why "Been There" Works Best for Our Audience

**Target audience characteristics:**
- Volunteers "off the street" (not professionals)
- Varied educational backgrounds
- May be nervous about safety requirements
- Need trust built before accepting guidance
- Diverse learning styles

**How "Been There" addresses these:**

1. **Trust-building through shared experience**
   Using "I" statements and personal anecdotes creates peer connection rather than authority positioning.

2. **Memorable story format**
   Research shows narrative structures improve retention. "First time I used a ladder..." sticks better than bullet points.

3. **Validates the learning curve**
   Admitting past mistakes ("I learned this the hard way") reassures nervous volunteers that not knowing is okay.

4. **Reduces resistance**
   People who "don't like being told what to do" respond better to experience-sharing than directives.

### Example "Been There" Opening

> "The reason they say '3-point contact' is because that's your stability. Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand - always. The moment you've only got two points, you're one shift away from trouble."

## Decision: Tone 1 (Straight Talk) as Runner-up

### When to Use Straight Talk Instead

- **Returning volunteers** who've already heard the full explanations
- **Time-constrained situations** where efficiency matters
- **Rule-followers** who just want clear direction
- **Follow-up to "Been There"** when reinforcing expectations

### Why Straight Talk is Secondary

While efficient and clear, Straight Talk:
- May feel cold to relationship-oriented learners
- Doesn't build the "why" understanding
- Less memorable for first-time exposure

It works best as a complement to "Been There," not a replacement.

### Example "Straight Talk" Opening

> "Keep three points on the ladder - two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand. Always. Stay centered. If your belt buckle goes past the rails, you're overreaching. Come down and move the ladder."

## Decision: Tone 5 (Quick Hits) for Infographics

### Why Quick Hits is Reserved for Visual Materials

Quick Hits is optimized for:
- **Point-of-use signage** (at the tool, on the ladder)
- **Morning briefing cards**
- **Pocket reference materials**
- **Infographic text blocks**

### Characteristics That Suit Visual Formats

- Extremely concise (25-50 words)
- Bullet/numbered format
- No preamble or context
- Assumes prior understanding

### Example "Quick Hits" for Infographic

> 3 points on the ladder. Two hands + foot, or two feet + hand. Belt buckle between the rails. Past the rails = overreaching = move the ladder.

## Tones NOT Selected as Primary

### Tone 3: Let's Figure This Out

**Strengths:** Engages analytical thinkers, builds understanding
**Why not primary:** Takes longer, may frustrate those who want quick answers
**When to use:** Complex topics, resistant groups, facilitated discussions

### Tone 4: Real Consequences

**Strengths:** Creates lasting impressions, effective for overconfident volunteers
**Why not primary:** Overuse feels like fear-mongering; inappropriate for minor hazards
**When to use:** High-risk tasks, post-incident discussions, complacency observed

### Quality Checklist (All Tones)

Before finalizing any content, verify:

- [ ] Would a real volunteer actually say this?
- [ ] Is the action clear?
- [ ] Does it respect the listener's intelligence?
- [ ] Is it free of jargon (or explains jargon immediately)?
- [ ] Could someone remember this on the jobsite?
- [ ] Does it pass the "not a lecture" test?
