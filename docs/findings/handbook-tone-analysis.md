## Executive Summary

The handbook uses a **formal instructional tone** with a clear organizational structure. It prioritizes clarity over warmth, uses imperative language for safety-critical content, and maintains a professional distance while still communicating care for participant well-being. The voice is that of an experienced instructor—authoritative but not condescending.

---

## 1. Sentence Structure Patterns

### 1.1 Definition Format (Most Common)
Tool descriptions follow a consistent pattern: **Bold Term** – definition with purpose.

**Examples:**
- "**Crosscut Saw** – a basic saw with coarse teeth for rough cutting lumber."
- "**Claw Hammer** – a 16 oz. hammer with a nail puller on one side and a nail driver on the other. This is the primary hammer used to drive and remove nails."
- "**Cordless Drill** – same as an 'electric drill' only this drill runs on a battery so it is more portable."

**Pattern characteristics:**
- Noun phrase followed by em dash
- Functional description first
- Additional context in separate sentence when needed
- Simple sentence structure (subject + verb + object)

### 1.2 Numbered Lists for Instructions
Clear hierarchical organization using numbered and lettered lists.

**Example from Key Concepts:**
1. Commonly used tools in construction and home maintenance.
2. Tool safety and care.
3. Job hazards and injury prevention.

**Example from Class Activities:**
1. Identify basic tools.
2. Describe the uses of each tool.
3. Discuss safety practices with tools at the work site and at home.

### 1.3 Short, Declarative Sentences
Safety rules use brief, direct statements.

**Examples:**
- "Inspect the ladder before you use it."
- "Always maintain a 3-point (two hands and a foot or two feet and a hand) contact on the ladder while climbing."
- "Keep your body within the side rails. Never your reach."
- "Never put one foot on a rung and the other foot on another surface."

### 1.4 Compound Sentences for Context
When explaining purpose or rationale, sentences combine instruction with reasoning.

**Examples:**
- "When cutting treated lumber, a mask and gloves should be worn. Be sure to wash your hands after using this treated product."
- "Keep track of all the tools. If you see something where it does not belong, please pick it up and return it to the correct work station."

## 2. Vocabulary Level

### 2.1 Reading Level Assessment
**Estimated Grade Level:** 6th-8th grade

The vocabulary is accessible to adults with varied educational backgrounds:
- Trade terminology is introduced with plain-language definitions
- Technical terms explained immediately upon use
- No assumed prior construction knowledge

### 2.2 Technical Terms Always Defined

| Term | Definition Given |
|------|-----------------|
| PPE | personal protective equipment |
| 3-point contact | two hands and a foot or two feet and a hand |
| Ripping | cutting with the grain of wood |
| Cross cutting | cutting against the grain |

### 2.3 Plain Language Choices

**Technical avoided → Plain used:**
- "hole in masonry" instead of "bore through masonry"
- "used for gripping and turning pipes" instead of "pipe manipulation"
- "make it fun!" instead of "gamification"

### 2.4 Measurement Specifications
Precise when relevant, practical when not:
- "16 oz. hammer" (specific)
- "2 lb. to 20 lb." (range for sledgehammer)
- "25' Measuring tape" (standard size)
- "at least 2" carpenter's pencils (minimum)

## 3. Pronoun Usage

### 3.1 "We" Usage
The first-person plural creates organizational identity and community:

**Examples:**
- "We do not use nail guns on Building Beyond the Walls job sites!"
- "We do not use powder actuated nailer on Building Beyond the Walls job sites!"
- "WE WILL ALL HAVE FUN AND ENJOY THE CLASS TOGETHER!"

**Pattern:** "We" appears primarily for:
1. Organizational policy statements
2. Community-building statements
3. Safety rules that apply to everyone

### 3.2 "You" Usage
Second person for direct instruction and responsibility:

**Examples:**
- "If you are ever at a volunteer site that uses nail guns, do not use without first getting proper instruction."
- "If you see something where it does not belong, please pick it up..."
- "Tools you might want to purchase in the future to help maintain your home."
- "Tools that will be at the job site that you need to know how to use."

**Pattern:** "You" appears for:
1. Direct instructions
2. Personal responsibility
3. Recommendations for personal life (home maintenance)

### 3.3 "Your" Possessive Usage
Emphasizes participant ownership and agency:

**Examples:**
- "your hands"
- "your home"
- "your body"
- "your tool belt"

### 3.4 Absent: "I" Voice
Notably, there is no first-person singular "I" in the handbook. This maintains instructor neutrality while allowing any instructor to deliver the content.

## 4. Imperative vs. Suggestive Language

### 4.1 Hard Imperatives (Safety-Critical)
No hedging, no qualifiers—direct commands for safety rules:

**Examples:**
- "**DO NOT USE WITHOUT AN INSTRUCTOR.**" (all caps, bold)
- "Always quote file paths..."
- "Never put one foot on a rung and the other foot on another surface."
- "REMEMBER-ALWAYS EXERCISE CAUTION AND COMMON SENSE!"

**Markers:**
- "Always" / "Never" constructions
- ALL CAPS for emphasis
- Bold text for critical warnings
- Exclamation points for urgency

### 4.2 Soft Imperatives (Instructions)
Polite but still directive:

**Examples:**
- "Please report any unsafe, dangerous, or hazardous conditions..."
- "Please keep trash in the dumpster and scraps below a certain length in the scrap bins."
- "Be sure to wash your hands after using this treated product."

**Markers:**
- "Please" prefix
- "Be sure to" construction
- Implied "you should"

### 4.3 Suggestive Language (Recommendations)
Used for non-safety content and learning suggestions:

**Examples:**
- "Tools you **might want** to purchase in the future..."
- "You **may also have** them indicate if this is the first time..."
- "(This activity is **optional** and can be done at any point of the training)."
- "When **possible**, these 'practice' pieces can be wall components for later use in framing."

**Markers:**
- "might want"
- "may also"
- "optional"
- "when possible"

### 4.4 Urgency Spectrum

| Level | Language Pattern | Example |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| Critical | ALL CAPS + Bold | "DO NOT USE WITHOUT AN INSTRUCTOR" |
| Important | Exclamation + Bold | "We do not use nail guns on Building Beyond the Walls job sites!" |
| Standard | Plain imperative | "Inspect the ladder before you use it." |
| Polite | "Please" prefix | "Please keep trash in the dumpster..." |
| Optional | "might/may/optional" | "You may also have them indicate..." |

## 5. Humor and Personality Elements

### 5.1 Playful Encouragement (Rare but Present)

**Example 1 - Measuring activity:**
> "Give baby candy bars to those who were accurate to make it fun!"

**Example 2 - Class closing:**
> "WE WILL ALL HAVE FUN AND ENJOY THE CLASS TOGETHER!"

### 5.2 Relatable Scenarios

**Example - Tool accessibility:**
> "Especially good if you have arthritis or difficulty in grasping." (Palm Nailer description)

This acknowledges real-world participant limitations without being clinical.

### 5.3 Practical Wisdom

**Example - Labeling items:**
> "Not used" (appearing under tools that Building Beyond the Walls doesn't use)

Rather than omitting dangerous tools, they're shown but clearly marked—acknowledging volunteers will encounter them elsewhere.

### 5.4 Overall Personality Score
**Warmth: 3/10** - Professional, not cold, but not conversational
**Humor: 1/10** - Extremely rare, only in optional activities
**Personality: 4/10** - Some voice emerges in safety emphasis and community statements

---

## 6. Structural Patterns

### 6.1 Section Headers
Consistent use of underlined, bold, capitalized headers:
- UNIT 1: TOOLS AND SAFETY
- NECESSARY TOOLS
- LADDER SAFETY
- MAINTENANCE SAFETY

### 6.2 Information Hierarchy

**Level 1:** Unit Title (underlined, centered)
**Level 2:** Section Header (underlined, left-aligned, bold)
**Level 3:** Subsection (bold, colon-prefixed)
**Level 4:** Numbered list
**Level 5:** Lettered sublist

### 6.3 Visual Integration
Tool images precede definitions, labeled A, B, C, etc.
Definitions follow in matching lettered list.

## 7. Tone Guide for New Content

### 7.1 Voice Principles (to Match Handbook)

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Authority without arrogance | State facts directly; avoid "you should know" or "obviously" |
| Safety first, always | Use hard imperatives for safety; never hedge on safety rules |
| Accessible expertise | Define terms immediately; assume no prior knowledge |
| Community identity | Use "we" for organizational rules; "you" for personal action |
| Respect for time | Keep definitions brief; add context only when needed |

### 7.2 Sentence Construction Guidelines

**For tool/concept definitions:**
```
[Term] – [functional description]. [Additional context if needed.]
```

**For safety rules:**
```
[Action verb] + [specific behavior]. Never [opposite behavior].
```

**For activity instructions:**
```
[Number]. [Imperative verb] + [object] + [method/purpose].
```

### 7.3 Word Choice Matrix

| Concept | Use | Avoid |
|---------|-----|-------|
| Requirement | "Always/Never" | "Should/Shouldn't" |
| Recommendation | "might want to" | "you should consider" |
| Warning | "DO NOT" (caps) | "Try not to" |
| Explanation | "used for/designed to" | "basically/essentially" |
| Permission | "You may" | "Feel free to" |

### 7.4 Formatting Standards

- **Bold** for tool names in definitions
- **ALL CAPS** for critical safety warnings only
- Underlined headers for major sections
- Numbered lists for sequential activities
- Lettered lists for parallel items (tools, options)

### 7.5 Pronoun Guidelines

| Context | Pronoun | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Organizational policy | We | "We do not use..." |
| Direct instruction | You | "Inspect the ladder before you use it." |
| Community statement | We/All | "We will all have fun..." |
| Never use | I | (Keep content instructor-neutral) |

### 7.6 Humor/Warmth Boundaries

**Appropriate:**
- Encouraging statements at activity conclusions
- Acknowledgment of real-world challenges ("arthritis or difficulty grasping")
- "Fun" mentioned in optional activities

**Not appropriate:**
- Jokes in safety content
- Casual language ("gonna," "kinda")
- Self-deprecation
- Pop culture references

## 8. Key Differentiators from Peer-to-Peer Tones

The existing handbook differs significantly from the selected "Been There" peer-to-peer tone:

| Aspect | Handbook Style | "Been There" Style |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Voice | Institutional instructor | Experienced peer |
| Stories | None | Personal anecdotes |
| "I" usage | Never | Frequent |
| Mistakes | Not mentioned | Shared openly |
| Warmth | Professional | Relatable |
| Format | Formal lists | Conversational flow |

**Implication:** New content should match the existing handbook tone for consistency within the Unit 1 materials, while the selected "Been There" tone represents an evolution for future content or supplementary materials.
