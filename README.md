## Tone Selection Summary

After evaluating five peer-to-peer tone variations against our target audience (volunteer construction workers), we've established the following content strategy:

| Role | Tone | Selection Status |
|------|------|------------------|
| **Primary** | Tone 2: Been There | ✓ Selected as best |
| **Runner-up** | Tone 1: Straight Talk | ✓ Selected as alternative |
| **Infographics** | Tone 5: Quick Hits | ✓ Reserved for visual materials |
| Not for presentation | Tone 3: Let's Figure This Out | ✗ Situational use only |
| Not for presentation | Tone 4: Real Consequences | ✗ Situational use only |

### Tone 2: "Been There" — Primary (Best)

**Selection rationale:** Trust-building through shared experience; memorable story format; validates the learning curve.

Why this works best for volunteer construction workers:

- **Trust-building through shared experience** — Using "I" statements and personal anecdotes creates peer connection rather than authority positioning
- **Memorable story format** — Narrative structures improve retention; "First time I used a ladder..." sticks better than bullet points
- **Validates the learning curve** — Admitting past mistakes reassures nervous volunteers that not knowing is okay
- **Reduces resistance** — People who "don't like being told what to do" respond better to experience-sharing than directives

**Example opening:**
> "The reason they say '3-point contact' is because that's your stability. Two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand—always. The moment you've only got two points, you're one shift away from trouble."

---

### Tone 1: "Straight Talk" — Runner-up

**Selection rationale:** Efficient and clear for returning volunteers and time-constrained situations.

When to use instead of "Been There":

- **Returning volunteers** who've already heard the full explanations
- **Time-constrained situations** where efficiency matters
- **Rule-followers** who just want clear direction
- **Follow-up to "Been There"** when reinforcing expectations

**Why it's secondary, not primary:** While efficient, Straight Talk doesn't build the "why" understanding and may feel cold to relationship-oriented learners. Less memorable for first-time exposure.

**Example opening:**
> "Keep three points on the ladder—two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand. Always. Stay centered. If your belt buckle goes past the rails, you're overreaching. Come down and move the ladder."

---

### Tone 5: "Quick Hits" — Reserved for Infographics

**Selection rationale:** Maximum clarity for point-of-use and visual materials; brevity optimized for glanceability.

Appropriate for:
- Point-of-use signage (at the tool, on the ladder)
- Morning briefing cards
- Pocket reference materials
- Infographic text blocks

**Why it's not primary:** No trust-building, no "why" explanation, assumes prior knowledge. Works as reinforcement, not first exposure.

**Example:**
> 3 points on the ladder. Two hands + foot, or two feet + hand. Belt buckle between the rails. Past the rails = overreaching = move the ladder.

### Tones 3 & 4: Not Selected for Presentation

These tones are reserved for specific situations and are **not included in standard content production**.

#### Tone 3: "Let's Figure This Out"
- **Strengths:** Engages analytical thinkers, builds deep understanding through collaborative exploration
- **Why not selected:** Time-intensive; works best with small group discussion; higher cognitive load than our primary audience can provide after travel/early mornings
- **Situational use:** Complex topics (Job Hazard Analysis), small group discussions, post-incident debriefs

#### Tone 4: "Real Consequences"
- **Strengths:** Creates lasting impressions, effective for overconfident volunteers
- **Why not selected:** Overuse becomes fear-mongering; inappropriate for minor hazards; amplifies anxiety in nervous volunteers rather than building confidence
- **Situational use:** High-risk tasks (falls, electrical, trench), observed complacency, post-incident discussions

### When to Use Each Tone

| Scenario | Recommended Tone |
|----------|------------------|
| First-day orientation | Been There |
| Morning safety briefing | Quick Hits |
| Signage and point-of-use | Quick Hits |
| One-on-one correction | Been There + Straight Talk |
| Refresher for returnees | Straight Talk or Quick Hits |
| High-risk task intro | Been There + Real Consequences |
| Complex topic discussion | Let's Figure This Out |
| Post-incident debrief | Real Consequences + Let's Figure This Out |
