# OSHA Safety Content Production - Project Goal

## Mission

Refine safety messaging to make OSHA standards accessible and impactful for volunteer construction workers.

## Target Audience

**Primary:** People "off the street" volunteering for basic construction work

**Characteristics:**
- Not professional construction workers
- Varied educational backgrounds
- Diverse learning styles (visual, auditory, hands-on, reading)
- May have limited prior safety training
- English may not be first language for some
- Wide age range
- Volunteering motivations vary (community service, skill-building, helping others)

## The Problem

OSHA standards are:
- **Important** - they save lives and prevent injuries
- **Poorly understood** - written for compliance officers, not volunteers
- **Intimidating** - dense regulatory language creates barriers
- **Abstract** - hard to connect to real jobsite situations

## Our Approach

### Core Tone: Peer-to-Peer

**Not authoritative. Not top-down. One volunteer helping another.**

We explicitly avoid:
- Lecturing or "teacher voice"
- Corporate safety-speak
- Compliance-focused language ("you must", "failure to comply")
- Condescending explanations
- Authority positioning ("as experts", "OSHA requires")

We embrace:
- "Hey, here's what I learned the hard way"
- Shared experience and mutual respect
- Practical wisdom from someone who's been there
- Honest about what matters vs. what's bureaucratic noise

### Tone Variations (All Peer-to-Peer)

| Variation | Vibe | Example Opening |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **Straight Talk** | Direct friend, no fluff | "Look, this is the one thing you actually need to remember..." |
| **Been There** | Sharing from experience | "First time I used a ladder on a site, nobody told me..." |
| **Let's Figure This Out** | Learning together | "Okay so PPE - what actually matters here?" |
| **Real Consequences** | Honest about stakes | "I knew a guy who thought hard hats were overkill..." |
| **Quick Hits** | Busy peer, respects your time | "30 seconds - here's what'll keep you safe today" |

### Tone Selection (Concluded)

After evaluation, we've established the following tone strategy:

| Role | Tone | Rationale |
|------|------|-----------|
| **Primary** | Been There | Builds trust; story format is memorable; validates learning curve |
| **Runner-up** | Straight Talk | Efficient for returning volunteers and time-constrained settings |
| **Infographics** | Quick Hits | Maximum clarity for point-of-use and visual materials |

#### Tone Usage by Content Type

| Content Type | Primary Tone | When to Use Secondary |
|--------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Presentations** | Been There | Use Straight Talk for returning volunteers |
| **Orientation packets** | Been There | Let's Figure This Out for complex topics |
| **Infographics** | Quick Hits | - |
| **Pocket reference cards** | Quick Hits | - |
| **Signage** | Quick Hits | Straight Talk for longer text |
| **Supervisor talking points** | Been There | Real Consequences when complacency observed |
| **One-on-one correction** | Been There | Straight Talk for repeat issues |
| **Post-incident debrief** | Real Consequences | Let's Figure This Out for root cause |

See [Tone Selection Decision](docs/findings/tone-selection-decision.md) for full analysis.

### Content Principles

1. **Start with "why"** - Connect safety rules to real consequences
2. **Respect the audience** - Never condescending, always empowering
3. **Actionable** - Every piece ends with clear "do this" guidance
4. **Memorable** - If they can't remember it on the jobsite, it failed
5. **Testable** - Can we verify understanding before they pick up a tool?

## Success Criteria

- Volunteers can recall key safety points without prompts
- Content works across literacy levels
- No injuries from misunderstood safety requirements
- Volunteers feel confident, not anxious, about safety
- Supervisors report fewer safety corrections needed

## Output Format: Safety Errata

**Not a replacement. A supplement.**

The existing Building Beyond the Walls handbook is large, but its safety section is small and doesn't cover all important cases. Our output is **errata** - like board game publishers releasing rule clarifications post-release.

### Why Errata Model Works

| Aspect | Full Replacement | Errata Approach ✓ |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Adoption friction | High - "learn new system" | Low - "here's what we missed" |
| Respect for existing | Implies handbook is wrong | Builds on what works |
| Scope | Overwhelming | Focused, digestible |
| Maintenance | Must track everything | Only track additions |
| Distribution | Replace all handbooks | Supplement existing ones |

### Errata Categories

1. **Gaps** - Topics not covered at all (JHA, working above/below others)
2. **Clarifications** - Ambiguous guidance made specific
3. **Updates** - Changed standards or best practices
4. **Edge Cases** - "What about when..." scenarios
5. **Deep Dives** - Expanded coverage of high-risk topics

### Errata Format Options

- **Insert sheets** - Physical pages to add to handbook
- **QR-linked cards** - Pocket reference with digital expansion
- **Companion booklet** - "Safety Section Extended"
- **Digital-first** - Searchable supplement with print option

## Current Focus

Refining messaging across tones to find what resonates with this specific audience.
